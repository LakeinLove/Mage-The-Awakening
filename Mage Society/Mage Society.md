_Mages do not lead ordinary lives. Their fascination with the Mysteries does not translate into polite dinner conversation among their Sleeper friends._

Their gaze penetrates [[Lie|the Lie]] that their families cannot overcome, and that makes it difficult for the Wise to connect intellectually with their un-Awakened loved ones.

A mage’s new awareness of the Supernal draws her into new social circles. All Awakened share a fascination with the Mysteries, so if one mage’s attention lands on some occult phenomenon the chances are another mage has noticed it as well.\
While this can occasionally lead to conflict if the mages view one another as competitors, a common interest is much more often the source of a potential friendship.\
Older, more experienced mages regularly draw the newly initiated into Awakened society by offering assistance to newer mages, and some Orders dangle small Mysteries in densely populated areas to identify new mages who might be lured into the fold.
