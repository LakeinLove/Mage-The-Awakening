- Skills are broad abilities, representing entire fields of knowledge or training.
- Skills reflect a character's origins and interests, and can be acquired in as many ways as one lives.
- Skills are, like [[Attribute|Attributes]], divided into Mental, Physical, and Social categories.
- They are things that are learned and gained, not [[Attribute|Attributes]] that represent more innate power.
