## Description

_Investigation is a characterâ€™s ability to find and put together clues and solve mysteries and puzzles. _
- It represents the ability to think laterally and make useful intuitive leaps, find meaningful patterns in confusion, and draw conclusions from the available data. 
- Using this [[Skill]] is different than the Perception [[Attribute]] task that can be found under [[Wits]] and [[Composure]]. Perception is typically checked when a character is not actively searching, but could potentially see something out of place or unusual. 
- Investigation is a [[Skill]] that the character actively uses to find clues and information and create a more concrete picture of the situation.
