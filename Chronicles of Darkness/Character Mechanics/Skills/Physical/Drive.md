## Description

_Drive is a broad Skill used for the operation of any motorized vehicle. It is used for manoeuvring and controlling automobiles, motorcycles, and even boats._
- It’s assumed that pretty much any modern character can perform basic driving under safe conditions, even without this Skill.
- However, if a character gets involved in a high-speed chase or tries to elude a tail, Drive is used to determine how well they handle themselves.
- The Drive Skill is needed when the character is in a dangerous or stressful situation, is trying to do something tricky, or is driving at very high speeds.
- If you want your character to be capable of piloting aircraft as well, you need to take the [[Skill Specialty]] in Piloting.
- A character without the [[Piloting]] Specialty is considered untrained if he attempts to operate a plane or other aircraft.
