## Description

_Survival represents a character’s experience and ability to “live off the land.” He knows how to find shelter, gather food, and endure harsh elements and environments._
- He can use the Survival Skill to find clean drinking water or hunt animals for food, build simple structures, and build a fire.
- The Survival Skill is not limited to wilderness or rural locales
- It can also be used to survive in an urban environment when you have no other way of getting food or shelter
- The Survival Skill does not cover dealing with animals beyond hunting
- The character can track an animal, but without the Animal Ken Skill, doesn’t understand much about the animal’s behaviour
- He wouldn’t have much luck trying to calm a bear that found its way into his campsite
