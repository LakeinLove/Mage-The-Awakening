## Description

_Weaponry is the ability to fight with hand-to-hand weapons. A character with this Skill can wield knives, swords, baseball bats, or even things like a length of chain or a chainsaw._
- If you are using a tool (other than a gun or bow) to do violence to someone, Weaponry is the appropriate [[Skill]] to use
- While guns are generally more dangerous, there are definitely times when you do not have access to one
- You can almost always find something that you can use as a hand weapon, even if itâ€™s just something like a screwdriver or a broom handle
