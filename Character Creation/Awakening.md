Awakening is an oft traumatic ordeal: it represents the understanding, both sudden, violent, and complete, that the world one in which one has lived is a lie. It is a confrontation both cruel and sudden, where the veil is peeled back and one truly sees.

Everyone has those moments, before Awakening, where they have a brief glimpse of the true world: where for but a single second, or even minute, everything becomes painfully clear. Then the phone rings, the baby cries, a siren plays in the distance, or someone comes knocking at the door and the moment is lost. The wool has been thoroughly drawn.

But, for some unlucky few, the moment doesn't end and they wander through the world without the weight on their eyelids. They feel something, they see something, and they feel they are on the cusp of understanding *something* if only they could find what it is.
Every interaction feels off, every sight and sound muted, tastes are somehow less vibrant, yet what exists layered atop them is a new sense: a feeling that something else is present.

And then, all at once, their eyes open and the Ordeal begins.

## The Ordeal
The Ordeal is the moment of true Awakening where one's soul is fired into the "First Dream" or "The Mystery Play", where the Sleeper becomes a Seeker, on their path to becoming an Awakened.

### First Dream
The First Dream is an astral journey. If one is in the Process of awakening while close to sleep, or is experiencing deeply traumatic emotions as a result of their nascent Awakening, they can slip into the First Dream.

Their consciousness becomes propelled across the Astral Threshold, into the the vast infinities of one's own soul. This eventually leads them along the thread of their soul to one of the five Watchtowers. This journey can be a slow trek along an imaginary plain inside their soul, a communion with a creature that represents different ideas and concepts, the depths of space, or even a rapidly changing scene for them to navigate.

These dreams features are all interpretive, every element and aspect filtered through dream-like logic to communicate ideas and give the Seeker some chance to raise their awareness.

### Mystery Play
The Mystery Play is a "waking dream" where the seeker experiences the real world as a dream. People and places become stranger, taking roles as if in a dream. A server at Hungry Jacks appearing to be a radiant angel, bearing the ambrosia of the gods; a $1 slushie.

For the Seeker, this becomes real, the ambrosia is truly divine, the cats in the alley truly giant alien bugs seeking to devour them, but only the Seeker can see this.The entire world becomes possibility, every action, every thing communicates deepest truths about the universe and the Seeker's relation to it.

This overlaid world is the Seeker's very soul, a part of their long-lost being that has been kept from them for so long. In the real world, they look like they're having the most insane trip of their lives. This reality is SO visceral in its verisimilitude that it is indistinguishable from normal, waking consciousness.

## Watchtower Initiation
Finally, after their individual Ordeal, the Seeker arrives at the base of the Watchtower that called them. "The Call", it is named, and it is this Watchtower that spoke the words etched into the Seeker's very soul.

This is the final destination from both the First Dream and the Mystery Play, their design and soul purpose.

The soul itself heard the words whispered to it from the Watchtower and brought the Seeker here to etch their true name upon it. The writing could take many forms, carving their name onto a blank slate presented to them as an award, scrawling one's name into the playbook they just finished penning, shouting one's name into the sky to mark itself upon its vibrant blue backdrop. Some deep and meditative sorts simply journey in darkness, and carve the word of their soul upon the dream-world itself with nothing but their wills.

This is the first true spell, the Awakened's declaration of their true self and their right to stand in the Supernal World. 
This is it.
This is the moment they Awaken, no longer a sleeper.
The moment they become a mage.
