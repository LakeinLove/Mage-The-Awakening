Sleepers dominate the populace.

The Awakened are so rare that they would not be considered a statistically significant deviation on the Census to warrant inclusion.

They are one-in-a-million, yet their influence on reality is so great that it is nigh-impossible to comprehend.

The Seers of the Throne, the bootlicker cunts who worship and follow the Exarchs keep watch on all major channels, they influence governments, societies, companies, and the world at large.

A distracted populace is a Sleeping populace, to let people explore the world and emotionally mature is an easy way to let people awaken to spiritual and emotional enlightenment, which oft leads to Awakening. This CANNOT be allowed to happen, and thus the Seers do everything in their power to stoke conflicts, keep people busy, enslave them with both law and wage.

Capitalism, Imperialism, Slavery, Greed, Racial "science" and Horror are all tools of control, none invented by the Seers, but all used and kept in good standing by them.
It takes little stoking of humanity to bring out the worst in us, like an owner can abuse a dog to become a monster that bites all who try to help.

However, despite their atrocities and control, humans are beautiful. We love, we cherish, we are kind and loyal and sweet. We hate and fear just like we cry and smile.
We. Are. Varied.

We cannot be held down, not all of us and not even by the will of gods. Thus, we Awaken, regaining the sight we should have always had, and returning to a tiny sliver of our true selves.

All mages know how precious their awakening is, and the Seers seek to steal this from all they can: It is a zero-sum game to them, and they intend to win.

Thus, the world is fickle, as not only are there dangers most beautiful and wonders most cruel, there are people who seek to rob everything from the Awakened behind every corner.

Secrecy is key.

To be Awakened is to seek knowledge and hoard it from others, to be as individualistic as possible.

Perhaps in merely the fear they instill in us the Seers have already won, but every person eventually reaches out to another, and the older and wiser of us know that to teach is to be rewarded with innumerable treasures.

That is how your mentor found you, alone. Scared. Confused. Angry at the world that lied to you all your life.

And they restored that thing that we all need to accept help, trust.

It took a while, but you met others, heard from your Master's Order at convocation, and are finally at the beginning of your journey. No-one can give you true knowledge, you must seize it for yourself and those you hold dear.
