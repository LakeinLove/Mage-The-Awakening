The worlds were once so close there was essentially no gap:
The Higher Realm, a place of magic, spirit, and the immaterial, and The Lower Realm, a place of matter, lives, and time.

Souls would manifest in the realm above, and in order to learn about the world itself they would descend to bodies made of flesh and bone, shedding their celestial raiment and become mortal.
These Souls would live as a mortal, grow, and eventually die, whereupon the soul would regain its divinity and return to the Realm Supernal to process and learn from the experience, improving itself and the worlds as a whole. Eventually, it would dive again, taking a small amount of its wisdom with it each time as a reward to help the world.

This resulted in eventually people becoming capable of spiritual sojourns to the celestial realm with some frequency, an act of mastery no doubt, but one that could be attained by any who worked toward it. Thus, magic was easily attained.

The First Great City eventually emerged, a place of particularly strong Supernal Resonance where lots of enlightened individuals gathered to study, share, and further knowledge of this beautiful art.

Sadly, the lower realm was host to the corruption inherent in ignorance, and eventually the selfish desires present only in this realm began to overwhelm the sense given from their ancient souls.
The First Mage War was sparked from growing hostilities, as those who wished to claim more power in this world fought against those who wished to respect the cycle that we all experience.
The ones who began the dissent were those who found the ideas of immortality and omnipotence horrific, the denial of all one is and must be, the refusal to live as people too much for them to bare. Thus, they rose up.

Their defeat was narrow, but not wanting to spill more blood in a vain attempt at curbing this egomaniacal trend emerging in the First City, the dissenters accepted their exile as they fled, hoping to educate others to not succumb to hubris.

The victors, those who would later be known as Exarchs, began their ultimate spell: The Celestial Ladder.
A literal stairway to the Supernal Realm, a path to true godhood and control of the world ruptured the delicate balance between the realms as it slip a heretical skein through the narrow Abyss and allowed the Exarchs to begin their reign.

At their apotheosis, the mages across the world felt the imbalance as mortal beings entered the higher realms, destabilizing the world and threatening to impose a warped order upon the lower realm.

This they could not abide, and all the disparate tribes, groups, and individuals united to stop this madness. The Oracles stood united for the first time.

They climbed the Celestial Ladder, fighting every step of the way, and began their war in the Supernal against the false gods who had taken reign. The Exarchs were powerful and numerous, having spent centuries studying to use magic specifically for this purpose: to lord over others, and a devastating fight ensued.

The Ladder, unable to maintain its atrocity upon reality shattered, Oracle and Exarch alike were thrust from the Supernal and the Lower Realm and Higher Realms move apart, the Abyss between them growing immeasurably. The aftermath was horrific, the sheer weight of this affront to reality reverberated through time, with myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel the result of this atrocity.

The Supernal Realms were now inaccessible, and worse yet the Quiescence descended upon humanity. The darkening of the soul, the closing of the eyelids, the great Lie, the Sleep.
The Abyss, cruel and unknowable, corrupted the now isolated Fallen World and mages became unable to use even the most basic of magics without Paradox - the horrific backlash inflicted by the Abyss on reality - lashing their beings and those around them.

Hope was dwindling, as even powerful mages began to Sleep, forgetting the secrets and knowledge the world fought so hard to attain.

Finally, when all seemed lost, the sparks of hope ignited in the bleak Abyss.
5 lights, beacons from the Watchtowers , shone brightly through the Abyss' lightless void. They tethered the realms together and began to call softly to the unawakened souls of Sleepers.

These Watchtowers started with those who had forgotten, restoring their bond with the Realms Supernal, if in a farm more limited state than before. The Oracles who had fallen were now the last to remember that struggle against the Exarchs, to pass this on to future generations.

However, just as they regained their memories, the Exarchs who were cast out also regained their knowledge, vowing to keep the Exarchs in power and keep the populace asleep. The Seers of the Throne were born.

The Watchtowers were, from stories told by the Oracles who fell and regained their power, the very souls of 5 great Oracles in the Supernal Realm, each burning their being in an undying flame to sing the words that uplift mortals.

The Oracles are alive, fighting guerilla warfare against the would-be gods of reality, the Exarchs.

Ostensibly, the Exarchs had won, but as long as mages still Awaken, there is a chance that the world can once again be whole.
