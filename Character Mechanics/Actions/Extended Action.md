An Extended Action is unique among actions, used to complete complex tasks.

- Roll your dice pool multiple times.
- Each roll takes a certain amount of time, and represents a step in the process.
- You either make progress or experience a setback.
- Determine your dice pool as normal.
- Make note of your Attribute + Skill + Speciality: That is the maximum number of times you can roll before it fails.

When you take an extended action, the Storyteller determines how many successes you require.\
Most actions require between five and twenty successes.\
Five reflects a reasonable action that competent characters can achieve with the right tools and knowledge.\
Ten represents a difficult action thatâ€™s still realistic for a professional in a field.\
Twenty represents a very difficult action that even a particularly skilled character will have trouble pulling off.
