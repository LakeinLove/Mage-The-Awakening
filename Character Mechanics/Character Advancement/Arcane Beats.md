Mages specifically gain a different type of [[Beats|Beat]] called “Arcane Beats,” which become [[Arcane Experience|Arcane Experiences]], alongside regular [[Beats]].\
[[Arcane Experience|Arcane Experiences]] help a mage achieve magical advancement.

Like with normal [[Beats]], a few major criteria allow you to gain them. And like normal [[Beats]], a given category can only net a single [[Beats|Beat]] per scene.
- Any time you fulfil or make major headway into an [[Obsessions|Obsession]], take an Arcane Beat.
- Any time you resolve a Condition resulting from spellcasting, [[Paradox]], or a magical effect, take an Arcane Beat instead of a normal one. Letting a spell causing a Condition expire does not count as resolving it.
- When failing a spellcasting roll, you may make it a dramatic failure and take an Arcane Beat.
- When your character risks an [[Act of Hubris]] against Wisdom, take an Arcane Beat.
- When your character spends a scene being tutored in a Legacy by a mentor or tutoring her own students, take an Arcane Beat.
- When your character has a meaningful and new encounter with the supernatural, at Storyteller discretion, you may take an Arcane Beat.
