_Characters in Mage: The Awakening advance through a system of “Experiences"._

---

[[Experience|Experiences]] are spent to increase and buy new character traits.\
[[Experience|Experiences]] are earned by accruing “Beats,” which are small elements of drama in the plot.\
These Beats come through fulfilling Aspirations, through good and bad things happening to characters, and resolving minor plot hurdles called Conditions.

All the elements of character advancement are:
- [[Beats]]
- [[Aspirations]]
- [[Condition Resolution]]
- [[Experience]]
- [[Arcane Beats]]
- [[Obsessions]]
- [[Arcane Experience]]
