_An Experience is a sign of meaningful progress in your characterâ€™s story, and her personal voyage through the plot._

---

Whenever you accrue five Beats, those Beats vanish, and you take an Experience.

You can expend Experiences at any time to increase your character traits. A single dot of a trait may cost one or more Experiences, depending on what it is.

## Experiences Table
