_Beats are measures of drama in the Storytelling system._

---

Five Beats become one [[Experience]], one significant moment able to advance your character.

You receive Beats for multiple things in the course of the story.\
[[Aspirations]] and Conditions are the most common ways to achieve Beats, but numerous others exist.\
Here are the main ways this occurs:
- Any time you resolve or make significant headway toward an [[Aspirations|Aspiration]], take a Beat.
- At the end of every chapter (game session), take a Beat.
- Any time you resolve a Condition, take a Beat.
- When you fail a roll, you can opt to make it a dramatic failure and take a Beat. 
- Any major dramatic event the Storyteller deems appropriate can award a Beat.

You can only receive one Beat from a given category in a given scene.

If you resolve three Conditions in a scene, for example, you only receive one Beat.\
However, if the moment is particularly dramatic, or youâ€™ve made significant sacrifice to trigger multiple Beats, the Storyteller can rule that multiple Beats are acquired.
