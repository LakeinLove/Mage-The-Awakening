_Arcane Experience is the Supernal equivalent to [[Experience]]_

---

Five [[Arcane Beats]] become an Arcane Experience, in the same way five Beats become an [[Experience]].

However, Arcane Experiences differ from normal [[Experience|Experiences]] in that they can only purchase magical traits.\
In this context, this means [[Gnosis]], [[Arcanum|Arcana]], [[Praxes]], and Legacy [[Attainments]].\
The costs are the same.

Also, note that [[Gnosis]] and [[Arcanum|Arcana]] _can_ be purchased with mundane [[Experience|Experiences]] and any combination of mundane and Arcane Experiences.

Legacy Attainments have a prerequisite level of [[Gnosis]].\
A mage who invents her own Attainments rather than learning from a tutor may only spend Arcane Experiences to buy them.
