## Description

_Larceny covers the generally-illegal skills of breaking and entering, lock picking, pickpocketing, safecracking, and similar activities._
- There usually aren’t schools for this sort of thing. Larceny is learned “on the job,” one way or another
- In addition to criminal applications, Larceny is used by magicians and illusionists for sleight of hand
- Most locksmiths will also have at least a little bit of knowledge of Larceny, as they understand how to open locks
- This [[Skill]] includes most of the tasks involving actually defeating physical security, or the sleight of hand required to pick a pocket or palm an item
- It does not cover sneaking around, hacking and digital crimes, or the social aspects of running a con or distracting a mark
