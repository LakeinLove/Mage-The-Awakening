## Description

_The Crafts [[Skill]] represents a characterâ€™s knowledge of repairing, designing, and creating things. _
- It covers tasks like rebuilding a car engine, laying a foundation for a house, or sewing clothing. 
- It also has some overlap with [[Expression]] for purposes of creating paintings or sculpture. 
- In general, Crafts should be used when you are trying to make something that is accurate (a scale model, an eye-witness sketch, or a reconstruction of a damaged manuscript) or useful for a specific task, as opposed to something that is being created to be beautiful or convey emotion. 
- A character using the Crafts [[Skill]] will generally need specific tools and materials. 
- They have the knowledge to make something, but they usually cannot do it with their bare hands. However, this generally should not cause them problems unless they are in a situation where the tools or materials are rare or difficult to access.
