## Description

_Empathy is a character’s ability to read and understand others’ feelings and motivations._
- It can represent careful observation of body language, tone, and other cues, or it could be an instinctive sense of which the character isn’t even entirely aware.
- It can help the character detect deception or uncertainty, as well as discern her target’s mood
- It does not inherently mean she is agreeing with or even behaving in a friendly fashion towards her target
- The Empathy [[Skill]] is simply the ability to understand and work with the emotions that someone is feeling
