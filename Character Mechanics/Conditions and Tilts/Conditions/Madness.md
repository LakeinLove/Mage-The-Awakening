This isn’t a mental illness born of brain chemistry — that, at least, might be treatable. This madness is the product of supernatural tampering or witnessing something that humanity was never meant to comprehend.

The Storyteller has a pool of dice equal to 10 – (character’s Integrity or Wisdom).\
Once per chapter, the Storyteller can apply those dice as a negative modifier to any Mental or Social roll made for the character.
