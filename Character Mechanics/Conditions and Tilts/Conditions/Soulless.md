_Something’s on your character’s mind and she just can’t shake it._

Persistent [[Conditions|Condition]]\
**Resolution:** Regain a soul.\
**[[Beats|Beat]]:** You lose Wisdom or Integrity because you indulged your [[Vice]].

---

The character is in the first stage of soul loss. Without a soul, she is more susceptible to possession — any dice pools to resist being taken over or possessed by another entity are at a –2 die penalty.

The effects on Wisdom and [[Willpower]], though, are more severe.\
For as long as she has this [[Conditions|Condition]], she does not regain [[Willpower]] through surrender or rest, and her use of [[Virtue]] and [[Vice]] is reversed. She may regain one [[Willpower]] point per scene by fulfilling her [[Virtue]] without having to risk herself, and regains full [[Willpower]] once per chapter by fulfilling her [[Vice]] in a way that poses a threat to herself.

Regaining [[Willpower]] through [[Vice]], though, is now a [[Breaking Point]] against Integrity with a –5 penalty unless the character has reached Integrity 1, or an [[Act of Hubris]] (roll 1 die) unless she has reached Wisdom 1 for mages.
