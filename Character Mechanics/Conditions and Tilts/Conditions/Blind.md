_Your character cannot see._

Persistent [[Conditions|Condition]]\
**Resolution:** Your character regains her sight.\
**[[Beats|Beat]]:** Your character encounters a limitation or difficulty that inconveniences her.

Any rolls requiring sight may only use a chance die. If another sense can be reasonably substituted, make the roll at â€“3 instead. In a combat situation, she suffers the drawbacks of the [[Blinded]] [[Tilts|Tilt]].

This [[Conditions|Condition]] may be temporary, but that is usually the result of a combat effect, in which case the Blindness [[Tilts|Tilt]] would apply.
