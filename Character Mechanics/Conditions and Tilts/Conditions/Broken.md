_Whatever you did or saw, something inside you snapped._

Persistent [[Conditions|Condition]]\
**Resolution:** Regain a dot of Integrity or Wisdom, lose another dot of Integrity or Wisdom, or achieve an exceptional success on a [[Breaking Point]] or [[Act of Hubris]].\
**[[Beats|Beat]]:** You back down from a confrontation or fail a roll due to this Condition.

You can barely muster up the will to do your job anymore, and anything more emotionally intense than a raised voice makes you flinch and back down.

Apply a –2 to all Social rolls and rolls involving [[Resolve]] and a –5 to all use of the [[Intimidation]] Skill.
