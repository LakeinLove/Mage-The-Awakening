_Your character has limited or no ability to walk._

Persistent [[Conditions|Condition]]\
**Resolution:** The character’s disability is cured by mundane or supernatural means.\
**[[Beats|Beat]]:** Your character’s limited mobility inconveniences your character and makes her slow to respond.

---

Her [[Speed]] trait is effectively 1. She must rely on a wheelchair or other device to travel.\
A manual wheelchair’s [[Speed]] is equal to your character’s [[Strength]] and requires use of her hands.\
Electric wheelchairs have a [[Speed]] of 3, but allow the free use of the character’s hands.
An injury can cause this Condition temporarily, in which case it is resolved when the injury heals and the character regains mobility.
