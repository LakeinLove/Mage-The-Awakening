_The character is in the second stage of soul loss._

Persistent [[Conditions|Condition]]\
**Resolution:** This Condition is only removed if the character regains her soul.\
**[[Beats|Beat]]:** You lose a dot of [[Willpower]]

Her instinctive efforts to shore up her [[Willpower]] by giving into her urges have failed, her Integrity has gone, and her [[Willpower]] is now fading\
In addition to the effects of [[Soulless]], she can no longer regain [[Willpower]] through her [[Virtue]], only her [[Vice]].

Indulging herself brings diminishing returns â€” whenever she does so, her permanent [[Willpower]] drops by one dot before she regains [[Willpower]] points to the new maximum. Mages lose a dot of [[Gnosis]] every time their [[Willpower]] drops, to a minimum of 0.
