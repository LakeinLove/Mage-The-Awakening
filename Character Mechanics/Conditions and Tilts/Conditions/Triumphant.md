_The character has won a Duel Arcane and her triumph radiates through her [[Nimbus]] for any Awakened to sense._

[[Conditions|Condition]]\
**Resolution:** The first time you fail a Social roll with a member of Awakened society, take a [[Beats|Beat]], and the Condition ends.\
**[[Beats|Beat]]:** Gain a [[Beats|Beat]] any time you throw your success in someoneâ€™s face, even if it risks making him angry or resentful.

Until the Condition is resolved, the character gets an exceptional success on three successes rather than five on any Social rolls with anyone in Awakened society aware of the victory.
