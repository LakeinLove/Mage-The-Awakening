_Your character has narrowly avoided Integrity loss due to witnessing magic._

[[Conditions|Condition]]\
**Resolution:** The character suffers Integrity loss. Take an additional Beat atop that of the breaking point.\
**Beat:** n/a

Take –1 to resist the next time you suffer a breaking point and must roll.\
If you have the Strained Merit, you may opt to not roll, and the Condition will build: each consecutive time you avoid rolling a breaking point contributes an additional –1 to your next breaking point roll, to a maximum of –5.\
After –5, you can no longer push the horror away, your character snaps, and you automatically roll for the breaking point at –5.
