_Your character has narrowly avoided Integrity loss due to witnessing magic._

[[Conditions|Condition]]\
**Resolution:** The character suffers Integrity loss. Take an additional [[Beats|Beat]] atop that of the [[Breaking Point]].\
**[[Beats|Beat]]:** n/a

Take –1 to resist the next time you suffer a [[Breaking Point]] and must roll.\
If you have the Strained Merit, you may opt to not roll, and the Condition will build: each consecutive time you avoid rolling a [[Breaking Point]] contributes an additional –1 to your next [[Breaking Point]] roll, to a maximum of –5.\
After –5, you can no longer push the horror away, your character snaps, and you automatically roll for the [[Breaking Point]] at –5.
