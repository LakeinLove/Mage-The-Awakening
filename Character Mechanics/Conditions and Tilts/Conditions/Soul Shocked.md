_Your character has been killed while on a sojourn outside her physical body, resulting in a shocked sense of self_

[[Conditions|Condition]]\
**Resolution:** Regaining full [[Willpower]].\
**[[Beats|Beat]]:** n/a

---

Upon gaining this [[Conditions|Condition]], roll her current [[Willpower]] points (not dots) as a dice pool.\
Ignore 10-Again on this roll, and do not roll a chance die if she has no [[Willpower]] left. She keeps one [[Willpower]] point per success, and immediately loses the remainder.

While this [[Conditions|Condition]] is in effect, your character does not regain [[Willpower]] from [[Virtue]], [[Vice]], or equivalent traits. She still regains [[Willpower]] from rest, surrender, and any other means of regaining [[Willpower]].
