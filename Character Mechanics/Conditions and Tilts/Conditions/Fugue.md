_Something terrible happened. Rather than deal with it or let it break you, your mind shuts it out._

Persistent [[Conditions|Condition]]\
**Resolution:** Regain a dot of Integrity or Wisdom, lose another dot of Integrity or Wisdom, or achieve an exceptional success on a [[Breaking Point]] or [[Act of Hubris]].\
**[[Beats|Beat]]:** You enter a fugue state as described above.

You are prone to blackouts and lost time.

Whenever circumstances become too similar to the situation that led to your gaining this [[Conditions|Condition]], the player rolls [[Resolve]] + [[Composure]].\
If you fail the roll, the Storyteller controls your character for the next scene; your character, left to his own devices, will seek to avoid the conflict and get away from the area.
