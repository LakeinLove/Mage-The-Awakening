When you make a roll relating to the topic, you may choose to resolve this Condition. If you resolve it and the roll fails, it is instead considered to have a single success. If it succeeds, the roll is considered an exceptional success.

The roll that benefits from the Informed Condition can be any relevant Skill roll. For example, a character with Informed (Werewolves) might gain its benefits when using researched information to build a silver bear trap with the [[Crafts]] Skill. Combat rolls cannot benefit from this Condition.
