- Tilt
---

_Something holds the character fast, preventing him from moving. This could be a grappling opponent, a straightjacket wrapped with heavy chains, or a coffin secured on the outside with a padlock._

---

**Effect:** The character can’t do anything but wriggle helplessly. He can’t apply Defence against incoming attacks and can’t take combat-related actions. If someone’s holding him down, he can spend a point of Willpower to deliver a head-butt or similar attack, but even that might not free him.

**Causing the Tilt:** The usual way to inflict this Tilt is through the Restrain grappling move. This often uses material means to prevent the victim from moving, such as binding limbs with duct tape or zip-ties, tossing the victim into a car trunk or similar tight space, or applying painful holds and joint locks.

**Ending the Tilt:** An Immobilized target can break free by escaping from a grapple or snapping whatever binds her. If grappled, the character can struggle as normal but can only select the Break Free move on a success. If held by an item, the character must make a Strength + Athletics roll penalized by the item’s Durability. If a character’s arms and legs are both bound, he suffers a –2 penalty; this increases to –4 if he’s hog-tied. On a success, he snaps the bindings or breaks free. Each roll, successful or not, deals a point of bashing damage.
