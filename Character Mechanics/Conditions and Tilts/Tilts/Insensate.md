_The character shuts down, either due to extreme fear or sudden pleasure. He may huddle in a corner, cringe away from sudden noises, or stare into space as waves of pleasure lap over him._

**Effect:** The character can’t take any actions until the [[Tilts|Tilt]] is resolved. He can apply [[Defence]] to incoming attacks, and if he takes any damage from an attack, he’s knocked free of whatever fogged his brain.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Several supernatural powers can leave their victim in a trance-like state of heightened emotion, whether it’s a vampire’s mind-affecting tricks or the pants-shitting terror of witnessing a werewolf take on an inhuman form. A truly heroic amount of alcohol or a hallucinogenic drug might have similar effects; administering such a drug is a [[Dexterity]] + [[Weaponry]] attack, suffering a –1 modifier for the improvised weapon.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** The [[Tilts|Tilt]] wears off at the end of the scene. The victim can spend a point of [[Willpower]] before then to act normally for one turn. A successful attack will also end the [[Tilts|Tilt]]. If a character has been knocked insensible by drugs, this [[Tilts|Tilt]] is replaced with the [[Drugged]] [[Tilts|Tilt]] when it ends.
