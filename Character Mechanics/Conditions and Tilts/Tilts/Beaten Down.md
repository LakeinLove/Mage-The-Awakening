_The character has had the fight knocked out of him._

**Effect:** The character cannot take active part in the fight without extra effort. The player must spend a point of [[Willpower]] each time he wants the character to take a violent action in the fight. He can still run, Dodge, and apply [[Defence]]. If he wishes to take another action, the Storyteller should judge whether the action is aggressive enough to require the expenditure.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** The character suffers bashing damage in excess of his [[Stamina]] or any amount of lethal damage.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** The character surrenders and gives the aggressor what he wants. At this point, the character regains a point of [[Willpower]] and takes a [[Beats|Beat]], but can take no further action in the fight. If the aggressor’s intent is to kill or injure the character, obviously surrender isn’t a good option.
