_The character has had the fight knocked out of him._

---

**Effect:** The character cannot take active part in the fight without extra effort. The player must spend a point of Willpower each time he wants the character to take a violent action in the fight. He can still run, Dodge, and apply Defense. If he wishes to take another action, the Storyteller should judge whether the action is aggressive enough to require the expenditure.

**Causing the Tilt:** The character suffers bashing damage in excess of his Stamina or any amount of lethal damage.

**Ending the Tilt:** The character surrenders and gives the aggressor what he wants. At this point, the character regains a point of Willpower and takes a Beat, but can take no further action in the fight. If the aggressor’s intent is to kill or injure the character, obviously surrender isn’t a good option.
