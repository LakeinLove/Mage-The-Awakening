_The character’s mind is addled by mind-altering substances, such as drink or drugs._

**Effect:** A generic narcotic can be represented with one set of modifiers: The character suffers a –2 modifier to [[Speed]] (and static [[Defence]], if used) and a –3 penalty to all rolls in combat, including [[Defence]] and perception. The character also ignores wound penalties.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** If the character has chosen to take drugs, then he suffers the effects. To administer drugs to another character is a [[Dexterity]] + [[Weaponry]] attack, suffering a –1 modifier for the improvised weapon. If the drug has to go in to a specific body part (such as an arm or mouth), it requires an attack against a specified target.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** A generic narcotic lasts for 10 – (victim’s [[Stamina]] + [[Resolve]]) hours. This time is halved by medical help, such as pumping the victim’s stomach or flushing his system.
