_The character can’t hear. Maybe he’s suffering intense tinnitus or can only hear the roaring of blood in his ears, or he just plain can’t hear._

**Effect:** If the character is deaf in one ear, he suffers a –3 penalty to hearing-based Perception rolls. A character who is struck deaf in both ears only gets a chance die on hearing-based Perception rolls, and suffers a –2 penalty to all combat-related dice rolls — suddenly losing the ability to hear the people around you is tremendously disorienting.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** A particularly loud noise within 10 feet of the character may cause temporary hearing loss as though the character were deaf in both ears. Alternatively, a targeted attack on the ear — at a –4 penalty — can deafen a character. Supernatural creatures with heightened senses can be deafened by loud noises at greater distances.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Deafness from loud noises fades after 10 – (victim’s [[Stamina]] + [[Resolve]]) turns. If an attack against the character’s ear does any points of damage, mark an ‘x’ under the leftmost [[Health]] box inflicted in that attack. If the damage inflicted is aggravated, the character loses hearing in the ear permanently. Otherwise, the [[Conditions|Condition]] ends when the damage that caused the [[Tilts|Tilt]] is healed.
