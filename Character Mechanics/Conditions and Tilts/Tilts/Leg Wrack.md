_Your leg feels like it’s going to snap clean off whenever you move; when you stop moving, you feel a burning numbness that encourages you to avoid moving._

---

**Effect:** If your leg is broken, sprained, or dislocated, halve your [[Speed]] and suffer a –2 penalty on Physical rolls that require movement (and [[Defence]]). If both of your legs are wracked, you fall over — taking the [[Knocked Down]] [[Tilts|Tilt]] — and cannot get up. Your [[Speed]] is reduced to 1; if you want to move at all, you cannot take any other action. Physical rolls that require movement are reduced to a chance die.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Some supernatural powers can cripple a victim’s limbs or break bone with a touch. A character can have his leg knocked out by a targeted blow to the leg (–2 penalty) that deals more damage than the character’s [[Stamina]].

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** If the [[Tilts|Tilt]] is inflicted as a result of an attack, mark an ‘x’ under the leftmost [[Health]] box inflicted in that attack. The [[Tilts|Tilt]] ends when that damage that caused it has healed. If the damage that inflicts this [[Tilts|Tilt]] is aggravated, the character loses use of his leg permanently
