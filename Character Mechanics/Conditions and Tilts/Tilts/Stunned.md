- Tilt
---

_Your character is dazed and unable to think straight. Maybe her vision blurs. If she’s stunned as a result of a blow to the head, she’s probably got a concussion._

**Effect:** A character with the Stunned Tilt loses her next action, and halves her Defence until she can next act.

**Causing the Tilt:** A character can be stunned by any attack that does at least as much damage as her Size in a single hit. Some weapons have a “stun” special ability. These double the weapon modifier only for the purposes of determining whether the attacker inflicts the Stunned Tilt. Attacks against the target’s head count the character’s Size as one lower for the purposes of this Tilt. The Storyteller might determine that additional effects cause this Tilt, like being caught in the blast area of an explosion.

**Ending the Tilt:** The effects of this Tilt normally only last for a single turn. The character can end the Tilt during her own action by reflexively spending a point of Willpower to gather her wits, though she suffers a –3 modifier to any actions she takes that turn.
