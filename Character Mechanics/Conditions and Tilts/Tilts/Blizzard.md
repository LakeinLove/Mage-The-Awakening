Environmental Tilt

---

**Effect:** Blizzards make it very hard to see for any real distance. Rolls to see things close to the character’s person, out to arm’s length away, suffer a –1 penalty. Each additional 10 yards inflicts an additional –1 penalty (cumulative) on all visual Perception rolls. This penalty also applies to ranged attack rolls. Moving through snow is difficult. Every four inches of snow applies a –1 penalty to appropriate Physical rolls, including combat rolls, Athletics, and so forth. The Blizzard Tilt rarely applies by itself — the Storyteller may also inflict any or all of the Extreme Cold, Heavy Winds, or Ice Tilts (all found below).

**Causing the Tilt:** The weather is out of the control of most characters — but not necessarily mages. The Storyteller should telegraph an incoming natural blizzard before it hits, but some willworkers may be powerful enough to call down frozen hell from a clear blue sky.

**Ending the Tilt:** Without supernatural powers, characters can’t “end” a blizzard. The best they can manage is to escape the weather or wait for it to stop. Proper equipment (such as goggles and snow boots) can add +1 to +3 to a roll, offsetting some of the penalties. If someone is causing this Tilt through a supernatural power, it’s possible that the characters could disrupt his concentration.
