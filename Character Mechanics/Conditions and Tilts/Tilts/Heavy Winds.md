_Howling winds buffet at the characters, whipping street furniture into the air, tearing the roofs from buildings. Powerful winds can toss cars around like toys. Anyone out in the winds feels like they’re taking a beating just for walking down the street._

Environmental [[Tilts|Tilt]]

---

**Effect:** Heavy winds are loud, so characters suffer a –3 modifier to aural Perception rolls. Also the wind inflicts a penalty to all Physical rolls when out in the winds — including [[Drive]] rolls. Grade the wind from one to five — one is tropical storm level (around 40 MPH), three is hurricane level (around 80 MPH), and five is tornado level (150+ MPH). This is the penalty applied to Physical dice rolls. Characters outside in the maelstrom take damage from flying debris, taking bashing damage each turn equal to the wind’s rating. Characters can make a reflexive [[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]] roll to avoid damage.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Heavy winds are a fact of life, from siroccos in the desert to tornados in the Midwest to wind shears everywhere.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Getting out of the wind is the best way to end this [[Tilts|Tilt]]. Sometimes that’s as easy as sheltering in an automobile — as long as nobody tries to drive. Buildings provide more permanent shelter.
