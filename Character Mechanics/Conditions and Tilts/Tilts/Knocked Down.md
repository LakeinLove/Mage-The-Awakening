- Tilt
---

_Something knocks the character to the floor, either toppling her with a powerful blow to the chest or taking one of her legs out from under her._

---

**Effect:** The character is knocked off her feet. If she hasn’t already acted this turn, she loses her action. Once she’s on the ground, a character is considered prone. The character can still apply [[Defence]] against incoming attacks, and can attempt to attack from the ground at a –2 penalty.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Some weapons list “Knockdown” as a special effect of a damaging hit. Otherwise, a melee weapon with a damage modifier of +2 or greater, or a firearm with a damage modifier of +3 or more can be used to knock a character down with the force of the blow. Alternatively, a melee weapon or unarmed attack can knock an opponent down with a targeted attack against the legs (–2 modifier). The attacker declares that he wants to knock his opponent down and halves the total damage done (rounding down). On a successful attack, the target is knocked down.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** The easiest way to end this [[Tilts|Tilt]] is to stand up, which takes an action. A character affected by this [[Tilts|Tilt]] who hasn’t yet acted can make a [[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]] roll, minus any weapon modifier, instead of her normal action. If successful, she avoids the effects of this [[Tilts|Tilt]] altogether. On a failure, she falls over and the [[Tilts|Tilt]] applies as normal.
