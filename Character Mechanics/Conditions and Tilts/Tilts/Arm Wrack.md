- Tilt

_Your arm burns with pain and then goes numb. It could be dislocated, sprained, or broken: whatever’s wrong with it, you can’t move your limb._

---

**Effect:** If your arm’s broken or otherwise busted, you drop whatever you’re holding in that arm and can’t use it to attack opponents — unless you’ve got the Ambidextrous Merit, you suffer off-hand penalties for any rolls that require manual dexterity. If this effect spreads to both limbs, you’re down to a chance die on any rolls that require manual dexterity, and –3 to all other Physical actions.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Some supernatural powers can cripple a victim’s limbs or break bones with a touch. A character can have his arm knocked out by a targeted blow to the arm (–2 penalty) that deals more damage than the character’s [[Stamina]]. A targeted blow to the hand inflicts this [[Tilts|Tilt]] if it does any damage.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** If the [[Tilts|Tilt]] is inflicted as a result of an attack, mark an ‘x’ under the leftmost [[Health]] box inflicted in that attack; the [[Tilts|Tilt]] ends when the damage that caused it has healed. If aggravated damage inflicts this [[Tilts|Tilt]], the character loses the use of his arm (or straight up loses his arm) permanently.
