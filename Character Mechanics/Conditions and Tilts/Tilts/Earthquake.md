Environmental [[Tilts|Tilt]]

**Effect:** Earthquakes don’t last long, but they don’t have to. When the quake’s actually occurring, all [[Dexterity]]-based dice pools (and [[Defence]]) suffer a –1 to –5 penalty depending on the quake’s severity. Characters take between one and three points of lethal damage per turn of the quake’s duration, though a reflexive [[Stamina]] + [[Athletics]] roll can downgrade that damage to bashing — or cancel it entirely on an exceptional success.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Without tremendous supernatural power, it’s almost impossible to cause an earthquake. A character who detonates a powerful explosive underground might simulate the effects over a city-block for a few seconds.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Earthquakes are fortunately very quick events. It’s very rare for one to last more than a minute (20 turns), so waiting them out is the best course of action.
