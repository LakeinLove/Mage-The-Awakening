_The character suffers from a panic attack, sudden imbalance, or a full-on psychotic break. Her pulse races and her mind cannot focus. The world’s an unstable place, and she’s unable to keep her balance._

**Effect:** Someone suffering a psychotic break isn’t the sort of person to go down without a fight. Her stated intent might be irrational or just plain impossible, and she might have fewer ethical problems with using extreme violence to get what she wants. The character gains a +1 bonus to all combat rolls, but takes actions after everyone else (if two characters suffer from the Insane [[Tilts|Tilt]], both act after everyone else but compare [[Initiative]] as normal). A character suffering from this [[Tilts|Tilt]] may spend [[Willpower]], but the cost is two points instead of one for the same effect.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Faced with extraordinary circumstances, any character with an appropriate [[Conditions|Condition]] may gain the Insane [[Tilts|Tilt]]. The Storyteller can call for a [[Resolve]] + [[Composure]] roll to resist a general anxiety that gnaws at the character’s mind; if the character fails, he gains the [[Tilts|Tilt]]. If the character witnesses something truly horrific — a daughter watches her father walk to the end of the garden and shoot himself in the head, smiling all the while; a man stumbles into the wrong office at work and sees his co-workers feasting on the intern’s organs; a soldier sees her unit gunned down by a sniper while she can do nothing — the Storyteller can rule that the [[Tilts|Tilt]] is unavoidable.

The Insane [[Tilts|Tilt]] can also be triggered by a [[Breaking Point]] or [[Act of Hubris]]. If a character loses a dot of Wisdom or Integrity during combat, the Storyteller may apply the Insane [[Tilts|Tilt]] then as well.

Some supernatural creatures possess mind-affecting powers that can apply this [[Tilts|Tilt]], even to characters who do not have an appropriate [[Conditions|Condition]]. This includes mages using the [[Mind Flay]] spell.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** The specific effects of this [[Tilts|Tilt]] don’t normally last beyond the end of the scene. A character can try to force her mind to a state of balance, but it’s not easy. She must sit and focus on blocking out the craziness. She rolls [[Resolve]] + [[Composure]] as an [[Instant Action]] contested by a dice pool of (10 – her [[Willpower]]). She can’t take any other actions that turn and doesn’t apply [[Defence]] against any attacks.
