- Tilt
---

_The character’s eyes are damaged or removed, or the character is placed in a situation where eyesight is eliminated (a pitch-black room or a supernatural effect)._

---

**Effect:** The character suffers a –3 penalty to any rolls that rely on vision — including attack rolls — and halves his [[Defence]] if one eye is blinded. That penalty increases to –5 and losing all [[Defence]] if both eyes are affected.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** The most common means of inflicting the tilt is to severely impair the target’s eyesight (using a blindfold, etc). An attacker can inflict temporary blindness by slashing at her opponent’s brow, throwing sand into his eyes, or kicking up dirt. This requires an attack roll of [[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]] with a –3 penalty; the victim’s [[Defence]] applies to this attack. If it succeeds, the target is Blinded for the next turn.

Blindness can also be inflicted by dealing damage to the target’s eyes — a specified attack with a –5 penalty. A successful attack normally damages one eye. It takes an exceptional success to totally blind an attacker.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** If an attack against the character’s eye does any points of damage, mark an “x” under the leftmost [[Health]] box inflicted in that attack. If the damage inflicted is aggravated the character loses vision in that eye permanently. Otherwise, the [[Conditions|Condition]] ends when the damage that caused the [[Tilts|Tilt]] is healed.
