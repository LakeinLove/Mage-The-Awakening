Environmental [[Tilts|Tilt]]

---

**Effect:** Affected characters suffer a –2 penalty to visual-based Perception rolls, including ranged combat, rising to –3 at medium range and –4 at long range.

**Causing the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** This Tilt applies to scenes of “natural” darkness with dim ambient light, such as the outdoors at night away from urban light pollution, and to disconcerting environments like a nightclub with its effects system on.

**Ending the [[Tilts|Tilt]]:** Bring, find, or create a light source.
