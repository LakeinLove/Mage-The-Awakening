_Your character’s Mentor is of particularly strong repute. This may be negative or positive._

---

When taking this Merit, determine the Mentor’s Order and Consilium Status. They should be close to the Mentor dot rating.\
As well, choose Social Merits equal to twice the Infamous Mentor dots. Your character can access these Merits and Status, so long as she’s willing to name-drop her Mentor and live with the consequences.

Most characters will grudgingly acquiesce to a Mentor’s Status, but will later look down upon the student for leaning on the Mentor’s reputation.
