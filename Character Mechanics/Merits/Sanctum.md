_Your character has a Sanctum, in which she can safely practice her art away from prying eyes._

---

This might be a dark cave, an apartment, a pocket dimension, or any other secure location she can claim. This Merit must be tied to a Safe Place Merit, and similarly can be shared within a cabal.

Add her Merit dots to her [[Gnosis]] within the Sanctum for determining spell control. She can leave the Sanctum and retain those benefits on previously cast spells. But if she’s exceeded her [[Gnosis]] and adds any additional, controlled spells, the benefit goes away and she must [[Reach]] as if she’d cast each of those spells without the benefit.

For an additional three dots (which do not count toward the 1–5 limit), your character’s Sanctum includes a Demesne.
