_Your character has influence over a Mystery Cult without actually being a subordinate member._

---

Perhaps your character is a “power behind the throne” or even worshiped as a deity.\
Your character benefits from the same level of Mystery Cult Initiation, without having to be tied to the cult. This means fewer responsibilities to the cult, plausible deniability if they’re revealed, and the ability to step away at any time.
