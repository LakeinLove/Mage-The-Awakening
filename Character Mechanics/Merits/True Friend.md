_Your character has a true friend._

---

While that friend may have specific functions covered by other [[Merits]] ([[Allies]], [[Contacts]], [[Retainer]], [[Mentor]], etc.), True Friend represents a deeper, truly trusting relationship that cannot be breached.

Unless your character does something egregious to cause it, her True Friend will not betray her.\
As well, the Storyteller cannot kill her True Friend as part of a plot without your express permission.

Any rolls to influence a True Friend against your character suffer a –5 penalty. As well, once per story, your character can regain 1 spent [[Willpower]] by having a meaningful interaction with her True Friend.
