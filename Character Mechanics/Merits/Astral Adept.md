Prerequisites:
- Awakened or Sleepwalker

---

_Your character is deeply in tune with her own soul, and may enter the Astral Realms without a place of power._

---

In addition to the Access Methods to the Astral Realms, your character may perform a ceremony to attune herself to the astral, then spend a Willpower point to allow her to meditate into the realms.

Decide what form your ceremony takes when buying this Merit; many mages use a Legacy Oblation, while Sleepwalkers might require special drugs, exercises, or chants.
