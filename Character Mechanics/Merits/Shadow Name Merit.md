_Your character has a particularly developed magical persona, and is almost a different person when acting as a mage than in her mundane life._

When purchasing this Merit, deter - mine the Shadow Name and its symbolism. The character may use those symbols as a persona tool in spellcasting, worth this Merit’s dots.

Additionally, apply dots in this Merit as a With - stand rating to spells that attempt to identify her or cast on her using the [[Sympathetic Range]] [[Attainments|Attainment]] when in her mundane persona, to spells using the Temporal Sympathy [[Attainments|Attainment]] targeting a time when she was in her mundane persona, and as a dice penalty to mundane skill rolls relating to identifying her as the same person as her magical self.
