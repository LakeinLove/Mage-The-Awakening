_Once per chapter, your character can dig within her dreams for prophetic answers to primordial truths._

---

She may enter her own dreams without a meditation roll when she sleeps, and if she has a basic understanding of something she wishes to divine from her dreams, you may use this Merit.

Your character must sleep or meditate for at least four hours. Then, ask the Storyteller a yes or no question about the topic at hand. He must answer accurately, but can use “maybe” if the answer is truly neither yes nor no.\
Depending on the answer, you may ask additional questions, until you have asked questions equal to your Dream Merit dots.
