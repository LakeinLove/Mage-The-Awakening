Determine how your character looks and how people react to that.
- For one dot, your character gets a +1 bonus on any Social rolls that would be influenced by her looks.
- For two dots, the benefit increases to +2. Depending on the particulars, this might influence Expression, Intimidation, Persuasion, Subterfuge, or other rolls.

**Drawback:**\
Attention is a double-edged sword. Any rolls to spot, notice, or remember your character gain the same dice bonus. Sometimes, your character will draw unwanted attention in social situations. This could cause further complications.
