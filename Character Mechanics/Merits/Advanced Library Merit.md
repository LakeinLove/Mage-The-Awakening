Cost: • to •••••\
Prerequisites:
- Library •••
- [[Safe Place]] (special)

_Your character not only possesses a massive, credible library, but she also hoards thorough information about highly secretive supernatural topics._

---

For each dot in this Merit, choose a topic.\
This could be “vampires,” “mages,” or any other supernatural force in the Fallen World.

When your character consults her library on one of those topics, take the [[Informed]] Condition relating to the topic. You can do this once per story, per topic.

Advanced Library has a special prerequisite; your character requires a [[Safe Place]] equal to its dot rating.\
As with Library, your characters can share a library location (and the players split the cost in dots).
