_Your character’s thread stands out in the skein of Fate._

---

Like the hero of an epic she is destined for great triumphs, but she also has a Doom that hangs over her head and threatens to turn her tale into a tragedy.

**Effect:**\
Each chapter, you have a pool of Destiny equal to your dots in this Merit. Each time you use a point of Destiny you may either gain the rote quality on a single mundane roll chosen before you roll the dice or reroll a single mundane action after you see the result of the roll (although you must take the second result).\
You may spend a point of [[Willpower]] when invoking your Destiny to affect a spellcasting roll.

**Drawback:**\
Your character has a Doom.\
This is the means by which destiny brings her life as she knows it to a tragic end — Dooms such as addicted, betrayed, crippled, devoured, enslaved, imprisoned, maddened, murdered, ostracized, possessed, ruined, or turned.\
This either kills her, or leaves her alive and suffering.

Whenever you spend [[Willpower]] to avoid the Doom, you add two dice instead of three (or +1 to a static value). However, whenever you spend [[Willpower]] on an action that will further the Doom but the roll fails, you immediately regain the spent [[Willpower]]. The Storyteller is the arbiter of which actions delay or hasten your character’s Doom.
