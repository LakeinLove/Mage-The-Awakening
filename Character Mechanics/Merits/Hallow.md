_Your character has secured a Hallow, a nexus of magical energies that seeps [[Mana]] into the world._

---

A Hallow produces one [[Mana]] per dot in the Merit per day.

When choosing this Merit, determine how the Hallow leaks [[Mana]] into the world. [[Mana]] that is not harvested congeals quickly into tass. Left to its devices, the Hallow can store three times its dot rating in tass before it becomes “dormant” and stops producing [[Mana]] until all of the tass is harvested.

As with [[Sanctum]] and [[Safe Place]], a Hallow can be shared between a cabal.
