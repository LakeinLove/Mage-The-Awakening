_Merits reflect aspects of your character but are an out-of-game resource._

---

Mage characters can take the following Merits. Unless otherwise noted, all these Merits have an additional prerequisite of “Awakened.” However, at Storyteller discretion, other characters may take these.\
For example, in your chronicle, you may decide that the Sanctum Merit should be available to Sleepwalkers affiliated with the cabal.

For example, your character may have friends, but you can choose to spend Experiences or Merit dots to purchase the Allies Merit.\
This gives those friends a direct effect in the game. If something happens to a character’s friends, specifically supporting cast not represented by Merit dots, the story goes on and nothing happens in terms of game mechanics.

If something happens to Allies, however, those points are not lost. The Allies dots disappear but you receive Experiences equal to the dots lost.\
This is called the Sanctity of Merits rule.

---

If your character loses a Merit, you may repurchase it in the next chapter of your chronicle.\
You can’t just say, “All right, my Allies died. I’m buying new Allies to call.” You’d have to wait until the next chapter.

Alternatively, you can spend those Experiences on other traits that are relevant to the situation. Maybe losing those Allies inspired a few trips to the firing range to let off steam, so you spend those points on a dot of Firearms.
