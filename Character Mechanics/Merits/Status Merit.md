_Your character has standing, membership, authority, control over, or respect from a group or organization._

---

This may reflect official standing, or informal respect. No matter the source, your character enjoys certain privileges within that structure.

Each instance of this Merit reflects standing in a different group or organization. Each affords its own unique benefits. As you increase your dot ratings, your character rises in prominence in the relevant group.\
Status only allows advantages within the confines of the group reflected in the Merit. Status (Organized Crime) won’t help if your character wants an official concealed carry firearms permit, for example.

Status provides two major advantages:
- First, your character can add her Status to any Social roll involving those over whom she has authority or sway.
- Second, she has access to group facilities, resources, and funding.

Dependent on the group, this could be limited by red tape and requisitioning processes. It’s also dependent on the resources the particular group has available.

**Drawback:**\
Status requires upkeep, and often regular duties are required. If these duties are not upheld, the Status may be lost. The dots will not be accessible until the character re-establishes her standing. In our Organized Crime example, your character may be expected to pay protection money, offer tribute to a higher authority, or undertake felonious activities.
