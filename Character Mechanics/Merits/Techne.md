[[Merits|Merit]]\
Cost: ••\
Prerequisites:
- Free Council Status •

---

_Your character uses Libertine practices in order to use cultural magical styles, sciences, and art forms as magical tools._

---

Pick a focus for your character — for example, computer networking.

Your character treats the focus as an Order tool for the Free Council as long as she includes it during spellcasting, and may further treat the presence of [[Sleepers]] engaging in the focus as a separate Order tool, as long as the spell is not obvious.\
If all mages casting a spell under the teamwork rules have this Merit representing the same focus, the leader’s spellcasting roll gains 8-Again.

This Merit may be bought multiple times to represent different fields of study.
