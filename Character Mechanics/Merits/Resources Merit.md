_This Merit reflects your character’s disposable income._

---

She might live in an upscale condo, but if her income is tied up in the mortgage and in child support payments, she might have little money to throw around. Characters are assumed to have basic necessities without Resources.

The dot rating determines the relative amount of disposable funding the character has available, depending on your particular chronicle’s setting. The same amount of money means completely different things in a game set in Silicon Valley, compared to one set in the Detroit slums.
- One dot is a little spending money here and there.
- Two is living well with some cash to spare.
- Three is big chunks of disposable income always ready to hand.
- Four is cashed up.
- Five is filthy rich.

Every item has an Availability rating.\
Once per chapter, your character can procure an item at her Resources level or lower, without issue. Obtaining an item one Availability above her Resources reduces her effective Resources by one dot for a full month, since she has to rapidly liquidate funds. She can procure items two Availability below her Resources without limit (within reason).\
For example, a character with Resources •••• can procure as many Availability •• disposable cell phones as she needs.
