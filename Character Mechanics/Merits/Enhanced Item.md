_Your character owns an item enhanced by indefinite Duration spells, which permanently modify the item’s properties._

Each dot purchased reflects one dot worth of spells the item contains. This Merit is not limited to the normal five dots.\
However, any purchased dots beyond the fifth count as a half-dot of spells.\
So, an Enhanced Item with nine dots actually contains up to seven dots’ worth of spells. If a spell uses multiple [[Arcanum|Arcana]], use the highest to determine the cost for this Merit.

Additionally, dots can be spent to directly enhance the item.\
A dot can provide +1 to the item’s bonus as a tool, a point of Structure, or a point of Durability.

This Merit can be combined with the [[Imbued Item]] Merit, but it cannot be combined with the [[Artifact]] Merit.
