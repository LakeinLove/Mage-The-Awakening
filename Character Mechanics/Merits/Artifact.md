_Your character possesses an Artifact, an item from the Supernal World which is both a physical symbol of magic and a unique item independently empowered to create sorcerous effects._

---

These items possess their own Mana stores, and have their own effective [[Gnosis]] and [[Arcanum|Arcana]] with which to generate effects. They can cast these effects when harnessed by an Awakened owner who has researched (or divined through [[Prime]]) the manner in which the item works.

In general, this takes successes on an extended research action equal to twice the Artifact’s Merit dots.

To calculate the cost of an Artifact, look to its single greatest effect, and map it to a spell effect. The base cost is equal to the highest [[Arcanum]] used, or three, whichever is higher. Each additional effect adds to the cost, but only half the highest [[Arcanum]] used (rounded up).\
Including a Utility [[Attainments|Attainment]] in a spell effect (for example, an Artifact that can cast at [[Sympathetic Range]]) increases the cost by one dot for each [[Attainments|Attainment]] included.\
The Merit is not limited to five dots.

The item can store Mana equal to twice the dot rating. The item’s effective [[Gnosis]] is equal to half the dot rating, rounded up. An owner can access and refill the item’s Mana as if it were her own, or can use it to fuel the Artifact’s abilities. The Artifact can also use its Mana as part of its own activation.

The Artifact has effective [[Arcanum|Arcana]] equal to the highest [[Arcanum]] used in its various effects. Artifacts cannot [[Reach]] beyond the “free” [[Reach]] for their [[Arcanum|Arcana]] ratings on their own. If an Artifact risks [[Paradox]], the user can spend Mana to mitigate [[Paradox]] (in any combination of her own or the Artifact’s Mana pool, up to her [[Gnosis]]-derived limits) and may choose to contain the [[Paradox]] herself. Otherwise, the Artifact automatically releases it.

Every Artifact will use its effects under different circumstances, determined when you create the Artifact. For example, an Artifact might cast its effect the moment it is first seen by human eyes, or whenever it’s dropped on the ground.

If an owner accesses the Artifact’s effects, she may use her own [[Gnosis]] and [[Arcanum|Arcana]], the Artifact’s, or any combination thereof.\
Every Artifact is also a Path tool [[Yantra]] worth +1 dice for mages of the Path of the Artifacts’ highest [[Arcanum]].
