Use your [[Brawl]] or [[Weaponry]] to calculate [[Defence]] rather than [[Athletics]].

You can learn both versions of this Merit, allowing you to use any of the three Skills to calculate [[Defence]].\
You cannot use [[Weaponry]] to calculate [[Defence]], however, unless you actually have a weapon in hand.
