_Your character is unnoticeable and inoffensive on a mystical level._

---

Any time a character tries to read your character’s aura, or otherwise use magic to discern bits of truth within her, subtract your Merit dots from their pool.

Normally, a mage’s spells carry with them a hint of his [[Nimbus]]. This Merit allows a mage to hide that, to metaphysically sweep that under a rug. Your character’s [[Signature Nimbus]] is faint, vague, and couched in more symbolism and oblique references than other mages’.

When someone attempts to scrutinize her [[Nimbus]] to identify her or track her, subtract your Merit dots from their rolls. The [[Withstanding Magic|Withstanding]] level of sympathy for spells targeting the character has a minimum of her Occultation dots.

**Drawback:**\
If your character ever gains the [[Fame]] Merit, or becomes noticed by the public at large, you can lose this Merit.
