_Your character has an assistant, sycophant, servant, or follower on whom she can rely._

Establish who this companion is and how he was acquired. It may be as simple as a pay check. He might owe your character his life. However it happened, your character has a hold on him.

A Retainer is more reliable than a Mentor and more loyal than an Ally. On the other hand, a Retainer is a lone person, less capable and influential than the broader Merits.

The Merit’s dot rating determines the relative competency of the Retainer.\
- A one-dot Retainer is mildly useful, mostly for reliably taking on menial tasks; sometimes you don’t need to be wowed, you just need to get a thing from point A to point B.
- A three-dot Retainer is a professional in his field, someone capable in his line of work.
- A five-dot Retainer is one of the best in her class.

If a Retainer needs to make a roll, if it’s within her field, double the dot rating of the Merit and use it as a dice pool. For anything else, use the dot rating as a dice pool.

This Merit can be purchased multiple times to represent multiple Retainers.
