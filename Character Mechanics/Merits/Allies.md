_Allies help your character. They might be friends, employees, associates, or people your character has blackmailed._

---

Each instance of this Merit represents one type of ally. This could be in an organization, a society, a clique, or an individual. You can take this Merit multiple times to represent different Allies.\
For example, your character may possess Allies (Police) •••, Allies (Organized Crime) ••, and Allies (Church) •.

Dots in this Merit reflect greater relationships and access. Work with the Storyteller to determine just what your character’s dots mean, and what she can request from her Allies reasonably.

When requesting help from Allies, the Storyteller assigns a rating between 1 and 5 to the favor. A character can ask for favors that add up to her Allies rating without penalty in one chapter. If she extends her influence beyond that, her player must roll [[Manipulation]] + [[Persuasion]] + Allies with a penalty equal to the favor’s rating. If the roll is successful, the group does as requested. Failed or successful, the character loses a dot of Allies (but Sanctity of Merits applies).
