[[Merits|Merit]]\
Cost: • to ••••\
Prerequisites:
- Seers of the Throne Status •••

---

_A successful Seer who has served her patron Exarch well can cast spells in his name._

---

She hears the Tyrants’ voices in her sleep. She understands their demands directly. A black iron portal forms deep within her Oneiros, and her daimon, the Goetia representing her drive to further herself, becomes twisted by the [[Peoples/Exarchs|Exarch]]’s agenda.

She gains the following effects, at each rank of this Merit:

### Chosen Vessel (•)

Your character gains the Persistent Mystery Commands Condition.

### Sword (••)

The character may use the patron [[Peoples/Exarchs|Exarch]]’s symbolism as a patron Yantra in spellcasting, worth half her Prelacy dots in dice (round up).

### Crown (•••)

The character gains an Attainment based on her [[Peoples/Exarchs|Exarch]]’s symbolism.

### Temple (••••)

If one of your character’s soul stones is incorporated into a Demesne, the Demesne becomes a Supernal Verge keyed to her [[Peoples/Exarchs|Exarch]], inhabited by Supernal Entities loyal to the Throne. Including Soul Stones from Seers with Prelacy linked to a different [[Peoples/Exarchs|Exarch]] causes the Temple to collapse and immediately destroys all soul stones involved.

**Drawback:**\
Once the [[Peoples/Exarchs|Exarchs]] have given a command, they expect it to be carried out without delay. The character may only earn [[Arcane Beats]] from their other [[Obsessions]] in a chapter when they have already earned one for following the one granted by Mystery Commands.
