_Your character is recognized within a certain sphere, for a certain skill, or because of some past action or stroke of luck._

This can mean favours and attention; it can also mean negative attention and scrutiny. When choosing the Merit, define what your character is known for.

As a rule of thumb, one dot means local recognition, or reputation within a confined subculture. Two dots means regional recognition by a wide swath of people. Three dots means worldwide recognition to anyone that might have been exposed to the source of the fame. Each dot adds a die to any Social rolls among those who are impressed by your character’s celebrity.\
Fame also scatters sympathetic links; the Withstanding level of sympathy for spells targeting the character has a minimum of her Fame dots.

**Drawback:**\
Any rolls to find or identify the character by mundane means enjoy a +1 bonus per dot of the Merit. A character with Fame cannot have the Occultation Merit.
