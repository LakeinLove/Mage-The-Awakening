_Your character has somewhere she can go where she can feel secure. While she may have enemies that could attack her there, she’s prepared and has the upper hand._

The dot rating reflects the security of the place.
- A one-dot Safe Place might be equipped with basic security systems or a booby trap at the windows and door.
- A five-dot hideaway could have a security crew, infrared scanners at every entrance, or trained dogs.

Each place could be an apartment, a mansion, or a hidey-hole.

Unlike most [[Merits]], multiple characters can contribute dots to a single Safe Place, combining their points into something greater. A Safe Place gives an [[Initiative]] bonus equal to the Merit dots. This only applies to characters with dots invested in the Safe Place.

Any efforts to breach the Safe Place suffer a penalty equal to the Merit dots invested. If the character desires, the Safe Place can include traps that cause lethal damage (up to a maximum of the Merit rating) to intruders; it is the player’s choice as to how much damage a given trap inflicts. This requires that the character have at least a dot in [[Crafts]]. The traps may be avoided with a [[Dexterity]] + [[Larceny]] roll, penalized by the Safe Place dots.
