_Your character has studied extensively in the Adamantine Arrow martial arts._

This allows her to use combat techniques as [[Yantra|Yantras]] for instant spells.

When taking this Merit, choose Athletics, Weaponry, or Brawl, which your character must have three or more dots in. This Merit allows use of that Skill in combat as a reflexive Order tool [[Yantra]], adding dice to a spell cast on subsequent turns, or to a spell cast reflexively in the same turn as the combat action.

You may purchase this Merit multiple times to reflect the other styles.
