A character's Willpower score is equal to [[Resolve]] + [[Composure]].

- Willpower is what mages use to clamp down their control on spells in a difficult situation.
- Spending a point of Willpower from their pool will grand them +3 dice bonus to a roll.
- A Master of an Arcanum can sacrifice a Willpower dot to create a [[Rote]].
- Mages can also spend [[Experience]] to recoup lost Willpower dots at the cost of 8 points per dot. (*See: [[Spending Experience]]*)
- Willpower can be used in conjunction with [[Mana]].
