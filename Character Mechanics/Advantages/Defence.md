Defence is equal to the lower of your character's [[Wits]] or [[Dexterity]], plus their [[Athletics]] skill.

- Subtract a character's Defence from any unarmed, melee, or thrown attacks of which the character is aware.
- Defence is decreased by 1 for every subsequent attack received in a turn.
- At the start of the player's turn, return their Defence to their normal value.
- Spend a point of [[Willpower]] to increase Defence by 2 against any single attacker.
