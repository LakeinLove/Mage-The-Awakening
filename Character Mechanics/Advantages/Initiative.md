A character's Initiative score is equal to [[Dexterity]] + [[Composure]].

- Initiative determines the speed at which one acts.
- Wielding weapons and other tools can give a slight reduction in Initiative depending on the weapon.
- If a character is wielding multiple weapons, they take the highest penalty and add an additional -1 for each other weapon. (Eg. Shield (-4) + Gun (-3) = -5 penalty)
- Initiative also determines someone's speed of reaction, their ability to be decisive and instantaneous with their actions and movements.
