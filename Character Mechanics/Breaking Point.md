- Breaking Points
---

_Breaking Points are the [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] equivalent of [[Act of Hubris|Acts of Hubris]], as their minds try to understand the Supernal against the forces of [[Quiescence]] and [[Dissonance]]_

---

Instead of Wisdom, [[Sleepers]], [[Sleepwalkers]], and Proximi use an Advantage called Integrity which represents the health of their souls and senses of self. Instead of [[Act of Hubris|Acts of Hubris]], [[Sleepers]] risk breaking points when they suffer psychological stress.

Witnessing magic is always a breaking point, as is killing another human being; but the Storyteller and players should work together to define a few situations that would constitute a breaking point for each character.

Characters using Integrity roll [[Resolve]] + [[Composure]] when they reach a breaking point, with modifiers for high or low Integrity (8–10 gives +2 dice, 7–6 is +1, 3–2 is –1 and 1 is –2) or situational modifiers decided by the Storyteller.

Whether the character succeeds or fails, reaching a breaking point applies a [[Conditions|Condition]] such as [[Guilty]], [[Shaken]], or [[Spooked]].\
Failing the roll means the character loses a dot of Integrity.\
Dramatically failing grants a [[Beats|Beat]] and changes the [[Conditions|Condition]] to a worse one like [[Broken]], [[Fugue]], or [[Madness]].\
Only exceptional success escapes a negative [[Conditions|Condition]]; the character regains a point of [[Willpower]] and takes a [[Beats|Beat]] instead.

Characters at Integrity 1 continue to suffer breaking points but cannot go to Integrity 0. Integrity may be raised after a protracted period of rest (and, potentially, counselling) for 3 [[Experience|Experiences]] per dot.
