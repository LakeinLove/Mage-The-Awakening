_These are the steps to creating a character. Don't cheap out. Do all of them._

At the bottom of this page will be a quick [[Character Creation#Checklist|checklist]] to make sure you have everything.

## Step One: Character Concept

If the character sheet is the map to your character, character concept is the legend. Character concept is a couple of words that describe your character in a dramatic, literary sense.\
Is your character a Puckish Rogue?\
Is she an Itinerant Researcher?\
Is she a Celebrant Technoshaman?

Perhaps the [[Path]], Order, or other setting snippets sparked a basic character idea. That idea is a concept.

Next, you’ll need three [[Aspirations]]. [[Aspirations]] are your goals for your character. Note that they might not be goals your character personally holds, but they’re goals you have for your character. For example, you might want to see your character lose a friend in the scope of the story. No reasonable person would want to lose a friend, but it’s a valid [[Aspirations|Aspiration]] because it’s something you want to see happen in your character’s story.

When choosing Aspirations, look to two short-term [[Aspirations]], and one long-term Aspiration. Short-term in this case means something that could happen to your character in a single game session, and long-term Aspirations are things that take a greater, extended effort to accomplish. Phrase Aspirations in a few words, but no more than a sentence. Keep them on the general and vague side, since more specificity means they’re less likely to be fulfilled.

Last, choose a [[Virtue]] and a [[Vice]]. These traits reflect your character’s personality and provide a means to regain [[Willpower]].

## Step Two: Select Attributes

Every character possesses nine basic Attributes. These [[Attribute|Attributes]] cover a character’s inherent capabilities. They come in three categories, Mental, Social, and Physical. Each category possesses three Attributes.

At this stage in character creation, each Attribute receives one free dot (as noted on the character sheet). Then, prioritize categories. Choose which grouping is most important to your character, then second most important, and last.

The top category receives five dots to distribute, the second receives four, and the last receives three. You may divide these however you see fit, but no Attribute can go above five dots in total.

## Step Three: Select Skills

There are 24 [[Skill|Skills]], divided into Mental, Physical, and Social categories just like Attributes.\
Unlike [[Attribute|Attributes]], [[Skill|Skills]] receive no free dots.

Prioritize categories the same way you did with [[Attribute|Attributes]], dividing eleven among the top category, seven to the secondary, and four to the final category.

## Step Four: Determine Skill Specialties

Now that you have [[Skill|Skills]] for your character, you get to refine three of them with Specialties.

[[Skill Specialty|Skill Specialties]] are single word or short-phrase descriptors that help to narrow down your character’s particular area of expertise.\
For example, your character might have [[Occult]] (Witchcraft), [[Occult]] (Herbalism), or [[Occult]] (Ghosts). Choose three Specialties.

When choosing [[Skill Specialty|Skill Specialties]], you can look at them in three major ways:

First, you can supplement inferior Skills that you still want your character to use.\
For example, your character might only have a single dot of [[Investigation]], but if you take the Specialty “Crime Scenes,” your character becomes much more effective in that specific field.

Second, you can maximize efficiency with a mastered Skill.\
For example, if you took four dots of [[Firearms]], selecting a “Rifles” Specialty makes your character remarkable with a rifle, and beyond other characters with just four dots.

Lastly, you can use Specialties to give your character a little personal flare and flavour.\
For example, your character might have a [[Crafts]] Specialty in “Model Kits.” This might not benefit your character directly in the game, but it says something about your character and her priorities.

## Step Five: 

This is split into a number of sub-steps:

### Path

Choose your character’s [[Path]]: [[Acanthus]], [[Mastigos]], [[Moros]], [[Obrimos]], or [[Thyrsus]]. Note your character’s two Ruling and one Inferior Arcanum from this choice.

### Order

Choose your character’s Order. Most characters will be in a Pentacle Order ([[Adamantine Arrow]], [[Free Council]], [[Guardians of the Veil]], [[Mysterium]], and [[Silver Ladder]]) but you can play a Nameless or a [[Seers of the Throne|Seer]] if the story works with them.\
Determine your 3 Rote Skills from the Order.

Assuming your character has an Order, she receives a free dot in the [[Consilium or Order Status|Order Status]] Merit, a dot of [[Occult]], and the [[High Speech Merit]].

### Nimbus

Describe your character’s [[Nimbus]].\
Flavour the [[Nimbus#Nimbus Tilt|Nimbus Tilt]], and consider how it effects your character.

### Dedicate Magical Tool

Determine your character’s [[Yantra#Dedicated Tools|Dedicated Tool]]. Her [[Path]] and Order determine possible magical tools.

### Arcana

Next, determine your character’s starting [[Arcanum|Arcana]].\
Your character starts with six total dots in Arcana.\
She may only have one [[Arcanum]] at three dots at this time.

Three to five of her starting dots must be in her Ruling Arcana, and both Ruling Arcana must have at least one dot. None of her starting dots can go to her Inferior Arcana.

The possible combinations are as follows:
- Specialist:
- 3, 2, 1
- 3, 1, 1, 1
- Balanced:
- 2, 2, 2
- 2, 2, 1, 1
- Generalist:
- 2, 1, 1, 1, 1

### Rotes

Your character starts play with three [[Rotes]]. She can only have rotes which she can cast with her Arcana. Look at their Ruling [[Arcanum|Arcana]] pages for example spells.

### Gnosis

By default, your character starts with a single dot of [[Gnosis]]. For five of her starting [[Merits|Merit]] dots, your character can start with [[Gnosis]] 2. For all ten of her starting [[Merits|Merit]] dots, she may start with [[Gnosis]] 3.

### Mana

Your character starts the chronicle with a full [[Mana]] pool, as derived from [[Gnosis]].

### Obsessions

[[Obsessions]] are like long-term [[Aspirations]], but grant [[Arcane Beats]] and [[Mana]] when you resolve and make major progress toward them. Characters with [[Gnosis]] 1 and 2 may have one Obsession. Those with [[Gnosis]] 3 may have two.

### Praxes

Your character has one [[Praxes|Praxis]] per dot of [[Gnosis]]. Look to the [[Arcanum|Arcana]] descriptions again and choose spells to be your initial Praxes.

### Resistance Attribute

The Awakening is tough on the mind, body, and soul. Every Awakened character begins play with one additional dot of [[Composure]], [[Resolve]], or [[Stamina]], which may not raise the [[Attribute]] chosen above five dots.\
Add this to your character sheet at this time.

## Step Six: Choose Merits

Every character begins play with ten [[Merits|Merit]] dots, unless some of those points were spent on [[Gnosis]].\
You may choose any combination of [[Merits]], but the characters must meet all prerequisites to purchase a Merit.

These Merits may affect other traits on the character sheet; be aware of these when calculating Advantages in the next step.

## Step Six: Determine Advantages

All characters have certain derived traits, which depend on their [[Attribute|Attributes]], [[Skill|Skills]], and [[Merits]].\
Determine the following Advantages and note them on your character sheet. If a Merit modifies your character’s Advantages, it’ll be noted in the specific Merit.
- [[Size]]: Characters start at Size 5.
- [[Health]]: [[Size]] + [[Stamina]]
- [[Speed]]: 5 + [[Strength]] + [[Dexterity]]
- [[Willpower]]: [[Resolve]] + [[Composure]]
- [[Wisdom]]: 7
- [[Initiative]]: [[Dexterity]] + [[Composure]]
- [[Defence]]: (Lower of [[Wits]] + [[Dexterity]]) + [[Athletics]]

You can now play a game!
