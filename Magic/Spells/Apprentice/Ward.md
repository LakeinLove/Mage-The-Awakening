_Space is mutable, until a magician wills otherwise._

---

Cast on an area or individual subjects, this spell locks its subject down, preventing the space within from being manipulated. Magic that uses the [[Sympathy]] of Warded subjects or attempts to warp Warded areas provokes a [[Clash of Wills]]. The mage is aware when one of her Wards is attacked.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage may specify a [[Keys|Key]] that allows use of [[Space]] magic on the Warded subject.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** The mage may cast Ward upon an Iris or its [[Keys|Key]], preventing the Iris from opening while the Ward remains in effect. Supernatural powers opening the Iris provoke a [[Clash of Wills]].
