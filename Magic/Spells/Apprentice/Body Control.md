_With this spell a mage can control her subject’s bodily functions to a degree that would make even the most inwardly-focused monks envious._

---

She can do far more than slow heart rate; she can control her subject’s metabolism, heighten reflexes, and consume less oxygen. 

For the spell’s Duration, each level of Potency gives one rank in each of the following:

_Breathing:_ Each rank slows down the subject’s breathing, halving the amount of oxygen she needs to function normally.

_Heartbeat:_ By slowing down the subject’s heartbeat, she can double the interval at which a toxin affects her.

_Metabolism:_ Regulating the subject’s metabolism allows her to subsist on half as much food, and doubles the amount of time between checks for deprivation or fatigue.

_Reflexes:_ Add +1 to the subject’s Initiative.

_Scent:_ The mage can change the subject’s scent to any that her body could naturally produce, eliminating (or increasing) body odours, controlling pheromone release.

Each level of Potency also halves the healing time of bashing wounds by controlling internal bleeding, preventing bruises or helping them to heal quickly.\
With Potency 3, for example, she would recover one bashing wound per minute

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The subject also gains 1/0 armour for the spell’s Duration as her body becomes much more resistant to minor injuries.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** The subject also halves the healing time for lethal damage for each level of Potency.
