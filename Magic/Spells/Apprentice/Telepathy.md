Apply the spell’s Potency as a bonus or penalty to relevant Skill rolls (such as Empathy or Subterfuge) between the subjects.

Subjects who carefully think of a message may use the effect to communicate telepathically along the link; this may require a Composure + Empathy roll for subjects unused to the sensation.
