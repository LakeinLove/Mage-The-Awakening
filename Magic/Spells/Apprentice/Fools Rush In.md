_According to old wisdom Fate favours children and fools, and this spell makes the old adage true. So long as the subject has little or no detailed knowledge about a situation before he enters it, the spell allows him to act with perfect grace and timing._

---

A turn or two of studying the scene before acting is acceptable, but extensive reconnaissance or a detailed briefing does not permit the necessary degree of randomness this spell requires.

The subject does not suffer untrained penalties during the spell’s Duration. If entering an unfamiliar social situation, the subject’s impression level also improves by one.

**+1 Reach:** The subject receives a dice bonus equal to Potency on a number of dice rolls (not including spellcasting rolls) equal to Potency during the Duration. The subject’s player chooses which rolls are affected (before the dice are rolled), and they can include any action or task, so long as they are instant or reflexive actions taken “in the moment” and not arranged ahead of time.

**+3 Reach:** Same as the first Reach effect, but this bonus can also affect spellcasting rolls.
