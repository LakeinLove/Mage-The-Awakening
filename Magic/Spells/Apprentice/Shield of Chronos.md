_The mage shields a subject against temporal senses._

---

While under the protection of this spell, any magic viewing the subject through time (whether looking at the shielded Duration from the future, or predicting the subject’s future while in the present) provokes a Clash of Wills.

**+1 Reach:** Instead of simply preventing magic from uncovering the subject during the Duration of the shield, the mage may design a false series of events that inquisitive powers “uncover” instead of the truth. Attempts to magically discern the illusion provoke a Clash of Wills.
