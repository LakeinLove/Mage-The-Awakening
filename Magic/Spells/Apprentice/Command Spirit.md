_Sometimes the gentle approach must give way to raw dominance._

This spell allows the mage to command a spirit to undertake a number of actions equal to the spell’s Potency.

This compulsion only lasts as long as the spell’s Duration, so the spirit might abandon an indefinite or extended action when the spell’s Duration wears off.\
Commands that go against the spirit’s self-interest (including abandoning a host or Fetter) provoke a Clash of Wills.

This spell has no effect on spirits above Rank 5.
