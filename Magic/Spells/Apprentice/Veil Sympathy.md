_A magician’s sympathetic connections allow her to reach out beyond herself, but they are also an avenue by which her enemies can attack her._

This spell conceals one of the subject’s [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] links, chosen by the mage from those she is aware of.

Any attempt to uncover or use the link provokes a Clash of Wills.

**+1 Reach:** Rather than suppressing a [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] link, the mage may instead make the subject appear to have a link to someone or something else instead. Attempts to detect the link provoke a Clash of Wills to see through the deception.

**+1 Reach:** The spell prevents the subject from being used as a [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] Yantra as well as removing its links; each level of Potency reduces all potential uses of the subject as a Yantra from Material, to Representational, to Symbolic, to suppressing them entirely.

**+2 Reach:** The mage may suppress all the subject’s [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] links. This effect applies in both directions; not only does the subject lose his links to loved ones, but those people lose their links to him. The spell is Withstood by the strongest connection the subject has.
