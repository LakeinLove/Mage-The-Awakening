_The mage can project an emotional state at her subject, instilling emotions that grease social wheels or create barriers between people._

---

The mage chooses at casting to project a positive or negative emotion at her subject, which allows her to open or close one Door.

Opening a Door usually occurs before an attempted Social manoeuvre, and the influence of the Door opening does not have to benefit the mage, but can benefit anyone dealing with the subject during the Duration of the spell.\
The mage may close Doors previously opened with the subject, making it harder for others to accomplish goals.
