_The mage can shield herself against harmful environmental conditions._

---

This spell provides complete resistance to any Conditions or Tilts caused by environments, up to an Extreme Environment level of the spell’s Potency.

The spell only protects against indirect damage, like heat and cold and minor hazards like hail.\
The mage can still drown or be crushed by crashing waves. While the spell wouldn’t protect her against lightning if something forced it to strike her, she wouldn’t naturally attract the bolt.

The spell requires a Clash of Wills to work against magical weather effects.
