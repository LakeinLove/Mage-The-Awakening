_The mage can hijack existing signals and change the transmitted data or its destination._

---

She can shorten or lengthen the transmission, and even change frequency, such as turning a Wi-Fi broadcast into a television signal. 

At this level, she must still work with a signal already present.\
Mimicking specific sounds or information requires a Skill roll or access to the data to be transmitted.

**+1 Reach:** The signal sent can be “encrypted” so that only certain actions, like specific keystrokes or frequencies, can receive them properly. Otherwise, they simply turn up as unintelligible “noise".
