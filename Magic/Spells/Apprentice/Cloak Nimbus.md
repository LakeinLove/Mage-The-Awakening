_This spell cloaks the subject’s [[Nimbus]] from spells and effects that would read it, such as Supernal Vision or the ability of certain psychics to read emotional states in auras._

---

Any such effect is subject to a [[Clash of Wills]].\
Any effect that fails to pierce the veil registers the subject as an ordinary [[Sleepers|Sleeper]].\
Spells cast while under the influence of this spell do not cause the caster’s [[Immediate Nimbus]] to flare unless she chooses to.

Furthermore, while this spell is active the subject’s [[Signature Nimbus]] is muted; any attempt to scrutinize it with [[Mage Sight]] provokes a [[Clash of Wills]].\
If the scrutinizing mage fails, he is unable to find any identifiable traits in the [[Signature Nimbus]].

If the subject takes any action that causes her [[Nimbus]] to flare, such as allowing it to do so when casting a spell or imprinting her [[Signature Nimbus]] on an object, this spell ends immediately.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** Rather than veiling her subject’s abilities completely, the mage may project the [[Nimbus]] of a lesser magician. For each[[Reach]] she applies, she may choose one of [[Gnosis]], [[Mana]], or any [[Arcanum]] she knows, and specify a value below her subject’s actual Trait rating. Any effect that fails to penetrate her veil registers the false Trait value. The mage cannot pretend to powers the subject does not have: An Adept of [[Prime]] can be masked to seem a mere Initiate, but cannot project the [[Nimbus]] of a Master, nor can she be made to seem an Apprentice of [[Space]] if she has no dots in that [[Arcanum]].
