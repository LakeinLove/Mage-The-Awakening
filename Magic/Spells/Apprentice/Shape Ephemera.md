_The caster may reshape [[Death]]-attuned ephemera from one object into a new object entirely._

---

This ephemera can be from a ghost or other entity in [[Twilight]], but they have the ability to [[Withstanding Magic|Withstand]] the spell, and being reshaped does not damage the entityâ€™s Corpus.

The object gains a Durability of 2.\
If it is a weapon it gains a weapon rating of 2; if it is armour it gains an armour rating of 2.\
Objects made of ephemera are only useful against other objects or beings made of ephemera or within [[Twilight]].\
Objects made this way can be used by any ephemeral entity in [[Twilight]], including ghosts or a mage who has transformed himself into ephemera.
