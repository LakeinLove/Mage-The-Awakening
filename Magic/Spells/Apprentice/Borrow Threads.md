_By changing one’s connection to others, one changes oneself._

---

This spell allows the mage to transfer a number of [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] connections equal to the spell’s Potency between herself and the subjects as determined by the spell’s Scale.

She can either steal links from her targets or give her own to others.

If the mage transfers a link to someone who already has a connection to the same thing, the new connection overwrites the old one for the Duration of the spell.\
The mage has to be aware of a connection (either through magic or just knowing the subject) to manipulate it.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may redirect the [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] connection between other subjects of the spell directly.

**+1 Reach:** Instead of transferring [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] connections, the mage may copy them.
