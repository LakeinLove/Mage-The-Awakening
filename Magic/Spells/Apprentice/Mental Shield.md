_The mage erects a mental shield that protects the subject from mental attack._

---

The shield provokes a Clash of Wills against any Goetia Numina, Influences, or Manifestations targeting the subject, any [[Mind]] spells, and any other supernatural creature’s mind-affecting abilities.

**+1 Reach:** The protection afforded by this spell extends to Goetia’s physical attacks.
