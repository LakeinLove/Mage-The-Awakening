_The mage can momentarily alter the flow of Time, causing it to speed up or slow down for a subject, but not drastically._

---

While the spell might allow the subject extra time to dodge an oncoming car or slow an enemy’s movements as though he were drunk, it won’t let her go back in time to avoid the car or the angry assailant entirely.

The caster may add or subtract Potency from the subject’s Initiative.\
Subjects who have already acted in a turn before having this spell cast upon them do not act again on their new Initiative rating.
