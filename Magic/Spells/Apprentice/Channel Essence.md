This spell allows the mage to draw Essence into her Pattern from a Resonant Condition or channel Essence to a spirit or suitable receptacle.

The mage may transfer an amount of Essence equal to the spell’s Potency. However, she cannot channel more Essence per turn than her [[Gnosis]]-derived [[Mana]] per turn rate.

Essence stored within the mage’s Pattern remains even after the Duration expires; however, she can only hold a combined amount of [[Mana]] and Essence equal to her [[Gnosis]]-derived maximum [[Mana]].

**Add [[Death]] •• or [[Mind]] ••:** The spell may be cast on a ghost or Goetia.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage may siphon Essence directly from a spirit, though the spirit may [[Withstanding Magic|Withstand]] the spell with Rank.
