_By cloaking her subject in Aetheric symbols of victory and indomitability, the mage shields the subject from the effects of hostile magic._

When the subject is the target of a spell, that spell is Withstood with the Potency of Wards and Signs.

Only spells that directly target the subject can be Withstood; a spell that turns the air around her into fire cannot be Withstood.

Likewise, if the subject is one of many subjects, Wards and Signs only Withstands the spell with regards to her. Other subjects suffer the full effects.
