By means of this spell, the mage twists the subject’s sense of direction, making him certain that the best route from where he is to somewhere else is one the mage desires

She could, for instance, convince the subject that the road to a dangerous Verge is actually the way to his mother’s house, or that the mage’s sanctum is in another part of the city.\
If the subject actively, carefully navigates using a map or GPS or the like, the navigation roll is a single chance die, and even on a success it feels wrong. (“The map _says_ left, but I _swear_ it’s right!”)
