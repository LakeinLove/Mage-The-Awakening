_The mage speaks with tongues of fire, and the world listens. So long as the words the mage speaks are objectively true and the mage herself knows them to be true, all subjects of this spell can hear her and understand her clearly, regardless of distance, noise, or language barriers._

Moreover, all subjects know, on a soul-deep level, that what the mage says is true. 

The spell only works on statements the mage knows to be true:\
She can’t use it to confirm or reject theories.

It also doesn’t necessarily compel the targets to act on the information in any particular way, but ignoring or refuting this Supernal truth may be grounds for a breaking point.\
In a Social manoeuvring action, this spell may remove one Door or improve the impression level by one step per point of Potency.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage’s words don’t merely ring with truth, they call to action. If a listener goes along with what the mage said, he gains the Inspired Condition. If, however, he ignores the mage’s words, he gains the Guilty Condition.
