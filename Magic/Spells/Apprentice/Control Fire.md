_The mage can exert control over a fire, fuelling it to increase its size and intensity or depriving it of fuel to snuff it out._

---

She can only control existing flames at this level, but can change a small campfire into a roaring inferno or bring even an out-of-control fire down to manageable levels.

For each level of Potency, the mage chooses one of the following effects (see Transform Energy table):
- Increase or decrease the heat of the fire by one level.
- Increase or decrease the size of the fire by one level.

If the fire’s heat or size are reduced to less than one, it is extinguished.\
Unless extinguished, once the spell’s Duration ends a diminished fire will eventually spread back out along available fuel.
