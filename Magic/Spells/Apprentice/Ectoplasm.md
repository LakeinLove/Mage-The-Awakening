_The mage can create ectoplasm._

---

The mage creates ectoplasm from one of his own orifices, or the orifice of a corpse — normally the nose or mouth, but sometimes the tear ducts or ears.\
The mage can shape the ectoplasm into any shape he wishes.\
The ectoplasm retains its shape for the Duration of the spell.

This is manipulated by [[Ectoplasmic Shaping]].
