_The mage can ward off the deleterious effects of advancing time on her subject._

---

This spell cannot undo effects, but can create enough of a buffer between the subject and [[Time]]’s endless march to buy what a mage needs most — time to think.

While this spell is active, the subject becomes immune to things that worsen with time. She will not bleed out from her wounds, and poison and toxins effectively halt their duration, as does the progression of disease.\
New Conditions and Tilts cannot be imposed on the subject while the spell remains in effect. Supernatural powers that impose effects provoke a [[Clash of Wills]].

The downside of the spell’s protection is that the subject no longer heals naturally during the spell’s Duration. More dramatic effects such as Pattern Restoration or [[Life]] magic can still heal her.\
More importantly, the subject cannot regain Willpower or Mana, or spend [[Experience|Experiences]] while under the spell’s effect. The subject ceases aging during the use of this spell.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The subject may ignore Persistent Conditions during the spell’s Duration. Time spent under this spell’s effects does not count toward any time necessary for Conditions to lapse.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The subject may heal naturally while under the spell’s effect.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The subject may regain Willpower while under the spell’s effect.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The subject may regain Mana while under the spell’s effect.
