_The mage creates a ward protecting the subject against supernatural effects that manipulate her fate — a Geas, a supernatural compulsion to act against her will, or having her fate manipulated by [[Fate]] magic or similar supernatural effects._

Each attempt to change the subject’s destiny provokes a Clash of Wills with the mage. This spell has no effect on pre-existing alterations to the subject’s destiny.

Additionally, the mage may selectively exclude the subject from any area-effect spell he casts. If cast on multiple subjects, this spell allows the mage to exclude each valid subject on a case-by-case basis.

**+1 Reach:** The mage can selectively exclude the subject from any spell she casts or any Attainment she uses.

**+2 Reach:** The mage may selectively grant protection from supernatural effects that target an area instead of individuals. This provokes a Clash of Wills to exclude the subject from the effect, which the mage may automatically pass if protecting subjects from his own spells.
