_The mage creates a receptacle for a displaced soul. The soul jar can be anything designed to hold and seal a liquid, from a paint can to a water bottle._

A soul placed into the soul jar cannot escape and is protected from outside attack. If the jar is opened or broken before the Duration of the spell ends, the soul is released.

**+ 1 Reach:** The mage may bind the soul to herself or to another person. To bind the soul to a person, the recipient must be suffering from the Soulless, Enervated, or Thrall Condition. Once the soul is in the body, it becomes the person’s soul for the Duration of the spell. An unwilling person Withstands the spell’s effect.

**+ 2 Reach:** By spending a point of Mana, the effects of this spell are Lasting, and the soul remains bound or attached even when the Duration ends.
