_What shows mastery more than a leash? With this spell, the mage may bind a spirit to the world, granting it a Manifestation Condition._

---

The mage may grant a number of Conditions equal to the spell’s Potency, and must create any prerequisite Conditions as well, if they aren’t already present.\
The entity immediately enters the Manifestation of the mage’s choice, and may not leave it while the spell remains in effect. This spell does not work on spirits above Rank 5.

**Add [[Death]] or [[Mind]] ••••:** The spell’s effects extend to ghosts or Goetia.
