Each level of Potency effectively grants the mage a dot of the Retainer Merit. The Golem’s “field” includes simple physical labor, combat, and other uncomplicated tasks.

The golem is completely mindless, and can only execute whatever order the caster gave it last. Orders must be very simple. If attacked, the golem has no Defence, but has Durability appropriate to its makeup (see Objects) and Structure equal to Durability + Size.

**Add Death •••• or Spirit ••••:** Bind a ghost or spirit into the golem to serve as an animating intelligence. The golem still uses its Retainer rating to determine dice pools, but the ephemeral being can use any of its powers, and the golem’s “field” is whatever the entity is capable of.

**Add Mind •••••:** Create an intelligence from nothing that will guide the golem and inform its “field.” See Psychic Genesis for creating a mind from scratch.
