_The tides of [[Aether]] ebb and flow, awakening sacred places and sending them to sleep once more in the cycle of ages. This spell allows the mage to bend that cycle to her will._

The mage may suppress an active Hallow or awaken a dormant one with this spell.

Rousing a slumbering Hallow requires a Potency equal to the Hallowâ€™s rating, while damping a Hallow reduces its effective dot rating by one per point of Potency.\
If the Hallow is suppressed to zero dots or fewer, it falls dormant.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** For one point of [[Mana]], the effect is Lasting.
