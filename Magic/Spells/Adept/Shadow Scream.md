This is an attack spell; its damage rating is equal to the spell’s Potency, and it inflicts lethal damage. 

This spell can target physical beings or spirits in Twilight.

**+1 Reach:** For one point of Mana, the spell inflicts aggravated damage.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may divide the spell’s Potency between damage rating and destroying Essence contained in the target’s Pattern. 1 Potency destroys 1 Essence.

**+1 Reach:** The target becomes more vulnerable to spiritual predation: she gains the Open condition.

**+1 Reach:** The spell can target beings on the other side of the Gauntlet.
