Subjects may use their Defence against attacks, if applicable. Unwilling subjects [[Withstanding Magic|Withstand]] the spell with Stamina.

The mage may direct the subject’s levitation each turn as an instant action. If she fails to do so, the object simply remains afloat in mid-air, coming to a stop wherever it was when she stopped moving it.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The subject retains momentum from turn to turn, floating slowly in whatever direction the mage initially directed it.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The subject flies fluid and free. She instinctively creates the telekinetic force as she manoeuvres in mid-air, granting her incredible speed and manoeuvrability. The subject gains an air Speed equal to the mage’s [[Gnosis]] + the spell’s Potency. While airborne she can make a Dexterity + Athletics roll to avoid obstacles, gains her normal Defence against attacks, and can fly without exhausting herself as she would by running.
