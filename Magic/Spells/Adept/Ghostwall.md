_All Fallen Matter is merely a shadow of Supernal truth, and this spell reveals the truth of that axiom._

The mage renders a volume of inert matter wholly or partly insubstantial, no more “real” than an illusion.

n. Insubstantial objects remain where they were when transfigured (that is, they don’t fall to the center of the Earth or fly off into space). Objects made insubstantial by this spell aren’t in [[Twilight]], they simply don’t register as “real.”

**Add [[Death]] •••, [[Mind]] •••, or [[Spirit]] •••:** The insubstantial object may be shifted into [[Twilight]], attuned to the used [[Arcanum]].
