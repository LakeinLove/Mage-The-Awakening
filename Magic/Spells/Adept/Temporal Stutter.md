_By redefining how a subject’s Time Pattern interacts with the present, the mage throws that subject forward through time, awaiting the moment the present catches up to him._

The subject completely vanishes from the Fallen World, and reappears unchanged when the spell’s Duration ends.

The subject experiences a momentary lurch in his perceptions, and then suddenly finds his surroundings changed by intervening events. The subject remains in the same location and retains momentum if he had been moving.\
If something now occupies the space the subject reappears in, apply the Knocked Down Tilt to whichever has the least Size.

**Add [[Space]] ••:** By using the Sympathetic Range Attainment tied to a destination, the spell brings the subject back at that destination rather than at the point he left.
