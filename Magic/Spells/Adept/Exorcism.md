_This spell rips a ghost’s grip on the world away. This spell strips a number of Manifestation Conditions from the ghost (or its host) equal to the spell’s Potency._

---

The effect is Lasting, but the spirit may use its Influences and Manifestations to re-establish the Conditions as normal.

**Add [[Mind]] or [[Spirit]] ••••:** The spell’s effects extend to Goetia or Spirits.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The target cannot attempt to recreate the destroyed Conditions on the same victim or location until the spell’s Duration elapses.
