_The mage creates false sensory input in her subject, tricking his senses and creating a hallucination._

---

The mage creates a single illusion that seems completely real to her subject.

She affects sound, smell, taste, and sight with the illusion, though she is unable to make the illusion tactile to the subject

**+1 Reach:** As above, but the mage can make the hallucination tactile to the subject. The illusion cannot attack or harm the subject in any way, but when he interacts with it, the subject believes he can feel the illusion. This may mean that a large illusion, such as a wall or other barrier, may make the subject believe he is incapable of passing through, barring his way.
