_Life magic can regenerate lost organs, limbs, repair fire-scarred tissue, and restore function to dead tissues, provided the subject is still alive when the spell is cast._

---

This spell can even cure brain damage, infertility, and birth defects.

Potency determines the extent of the organs that may be regenerated. Affected body parts regenerate (growing from nothing if the limb or organ has been completely removed) at a rate of about one minute per level of Potency required.

Most mages cast this spell with a Duration of Indefinite, but some either can’t or don’t — keeping a target dependent upon her magic for brain function or a healthy, fully-functional body is a powerful bargaining chip.

When the spell expires, the regenerated tissues wither away in less than a minute.
