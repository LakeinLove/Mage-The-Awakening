_The mage is capable of temporarily granting the subject a Skill, granting a number of dots in one Skill per level of Potency of the spell._

---

The spell cannot increase the subject’s Skill above the normal maximum.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may grant an additional Skill with the spell for each additional Reach spent, dividing the spell’s Potency among them. For example, a mage can spend +2 Reach with a Potency 4 spell to gain the Subterfuge Skill at one dot, the Intimidate Skill at two dots, and the Empathy Skill at one dot.

**+1 Reach:** By spending one Mana, the mage may increase one of the subject’s new Skills above the normal maximum.
