_The mage creates a Familiar bond between a spirit and a mage, who must both be subjects of the spell._

---

The spirit may not be greater than Rank 2.

The mage gains the Familiar Merit and the spirit the Familiar Manifestation Condition for the Duration of the spell. Both parties must be willing, and can end the bond whenever they wish.

**Substitute Death •••• or Mind ••••:** The mage may bind a ghost or a Goetia as a familiar instead.
