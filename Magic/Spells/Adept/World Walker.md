This spell allows the mage to bring a subject directly across the Gauntlet, either to or from the Shadow, without the need for a portal. If the subject is a spirit or ephemeral object, it appears in Twilight.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may grant a conjured spirit or ephemeral object the Materialized Condition, which lasts until the spellâ€™s Duration expires.
