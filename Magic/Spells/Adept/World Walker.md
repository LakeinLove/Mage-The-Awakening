This spell allows the mage to bring a subject directly across [[the Gauntlet]], either to or from [[The Shadow]], without the need for a portal. If the subject is a spirit or ephemeral object, it appears in [[Twilight]].

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage may grant a conjured spirit or ephemeral object the Materialized Condition, which lasts until the spellâ€™s Duration expires.
