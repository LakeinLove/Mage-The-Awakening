_Supernal truths can never truly be unmade, but with this spell the mage may cast them back across the Abyss, effectively erasing any spell she comes across._

A successful casting suppresses the spell for the Duration of Supernal Dispellation.

This spell is not potent enough to dispel archmages’ spells.

**Add [[Fate]] •:** The mage may suppress the subject spell selectively, for a number of subjects equal to the Dispel’s Scale factor.

**+2 Reach:** For one point of Mana, the effect is Lasting. If the spell’s original caster is still alive and has not relinquished the spell, she knows one of her spells was destroyed.
