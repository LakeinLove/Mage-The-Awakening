_Supernal truths can never truly be unmade, but with this spell the mage may cast them back across [[The Abyss]], effectively erasing any spell she comes across._

A successful casting suppresses the spell for the Duration of Supernal Dispellation.

This spell is not potent enough to dispel archmages’ spells.

**Add [[Fate]] •:** The mage may suppress the subject spell selectively, for a number of subjects equal to the Dispel’s Scale factor.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** For one point of [[Mana]], the effect is Lasting. If the spell’s original caster is still alive and has not relinquished the spell, she knows one of her spells was destroyed.
