_The roads of destiny fork and converge, governing the probability of events. An adept of Fate can re-weave the strings of Fate on a subject, encouraging (if not ensuring) that a specified event will happen as long as the spell remains active._

---

The mage specifies an event that she wishes to happen to the subject. If the event would be possible without magic or any effort on the subject’s part, it occurs as soon as circumstances allow as long as the spell’s Duration is in effect.\
If the event requires the subject’s participation or cannot take place without a change in circumstances, the spell introduces opportunities to work towards the event, at least once per week while the spell remains on the subject. If the event is simply impossible, the spell has no effect.

For example, if a mage casts the spell on herself and specifies that she will meet with her mentor while they are both in the same city, they will “randomly” cross paths at first opportunity.\
If she casts it on a Sleepwalker ally and specifies that he will recover a stolen artifact (when, unknown to her, it has been moved) he will find travel tickets for the artifact’s new location, clues pointing there, or reasons to travel there. If she cast it on a student and specifies that he will become a doctor, circumstances will hint at a transfer to pre-med.

The spell cannot deal damage directly, though it can put subjects in harm’s way. For example, a mage could curse a victim with this spell specifying that she will be in a car wreck, or exposed to a disease.

**+1 Reach:** The spell presents opportunities to work toward the specified event once per day.
