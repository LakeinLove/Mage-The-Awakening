_Much like Windstrike, this spell causes inanimate matter to lash out at the subject._

---

But where Windstrike lashes out with air and water, this spell causes the Earth itself to rise up and crush the subject.

This is an attack spell; its damage rating is equal to the spellâ€™s Potency, and it inflicts lethal damage.

**+1 Reach:** The warped matter of this spell sticks around after casting, creating an Environmental Tilt like Earthquake in the immediate vicinity.

**+1 Reach:** For one point of Mana, the spell inflicts aggravated damage.
