This spell allows the mage to reshape a spirit’s fundamental nature.\
She may invoke a number of the following effects equal to the spell’s Potency:
- Change the spirit’s fundamental nature; for example, making a mouse spirit into a spirit of bad luck and mischief.
- Redistribute the spirit’s Attribute dots.
- Heal one box of lethal damage from the spirit’s Corpus.
- Redefine and redistribute the spirit’s Influences.
- Add, remove, or replace one Manifestation.
- Add, remove, or replace one Numen
- Rewrite the spirit's Ban and Bane

She can also alter the spirit’s size, shape, and appearance as she sees fit, within the limits of the spell’s Scale factor.\
The spirit’s new traits must stay within its Rank-derived maximums.\
When the spell’s Duration expires, the spirit returns to its original form and capabilities.

**+1 Reach:** For one Mana, the spell may heal aggravated damage.
