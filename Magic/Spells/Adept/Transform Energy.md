_All energy shares sympathy, born perhaps from the same cosmic source in the same instant._

---

An Adept of [[Forces]] can use that sympathy to transform one energy type into another. The table below serves as a rough equivalency chart for different energy types.

She can change a room full of light into heat, at once turning it into a pitch-black oven. She might also change the thunderous roar of a waterfall into electricity, far more efficient than any hydroelectric dam. 

The spell may affect energy of a level equal to Potency.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** the mage may decrease the level of the energy transformed by one. This[[Reach]] may be applied multiple times.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** the mage may split a source of energy into two different kinds or leave part of the original source behind â€” for example, turning an inferno into light equivalent to daylight and sound equivalent to a scream.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** For one [[Mana]], the mage may increase the level of the energy transformed by one.
