_The mage casts a powerful curse that either encourages the subject to achieve a goal specified by the mage when he casts this spell, or that thwarts the subject’s every attempt to pursue such a goal._

---

The subject must, however, be aware of the goal, and the mage cannot levy impossible tasks.

One of the subject’s [[Aspirations]] is replaced by the goal.

As a goad, the subject suffers ill luck except when taking constructive action to bring her closer to achieving the stated goal. If the subject has not pursued the spell’s objective in a meaningful way within the last 24 hours, she suffers a [[Hexes|Hex]].

As a ban, the subject suffers ill luck whenever he attempts to achieve the forbidden goal. For the Duration of the spell, the subject suffers a [[Hexes|Hex]] if she actively strives toward it.
