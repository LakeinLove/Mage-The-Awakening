_The mage may grant a ghost a Manifestation Condition._

---

The mage may grant a number of Conditions equal to the spell’s Potency, and must create any prerequisite Conditions as well, if they aren’t already present.

The entity immediately enters the Manifestation of the mage’s choice, and may not leave it while the spell remains in effect.\
Mages often use this spell to allow ghosts to Possess their own corpses, creating undead beings called revenants.

**Add [[Mind]] or [[Spirit]] ••••:** The spell’s effects extend to Goetia or Spirits.
