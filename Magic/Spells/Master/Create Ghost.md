She can fashion the ghost as an echo of another person, either alive or dead, though the ghost is not the actual person.

The ghost is created at Rank 1 and remains for the Duration of the spell as the mageâ€™s loyal servant, and she is able to direct it to take actions without the use of any additional spells.

**+1 Reach:** For one Mana, the ghost created is Rank 2.
