This spell generates a quantity of Essence equal to the spell’s Potency within the subject’s Pattern.

The Essence has a Resonance of the mage’s choosing, as long as she’s encountered it before.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may “flavour” the Essence with multiple Resonances she has previously encountered.
