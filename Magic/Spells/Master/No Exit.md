_The mage creates a mental thought loop for her subject, trapping him within his own mind._

---

For the Duration of the spell, the subject is unable to do anything but play through a single continuous loop in his mind.\
Thoughts cannot enter or exit the subject’s mind, and he appears nearly catatonic to outside observers.

Attempts to read the subject’s mind or memories reveal the thought loop. Supernatural attempts to force new thoughts provoke a Clash of Wills.
