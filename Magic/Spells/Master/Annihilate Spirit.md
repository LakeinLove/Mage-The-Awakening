_The most fearsome spell in most shamans’ arsenal, this terrible magic utterly destroys a spirit._

---

The target spirit may spend an Essence to roll Power + Finesse in a [[Clash of Wills]], a last-ditch attempt to reassert its existence through its Influences.\
If the spell is successfully cast, the spirit is instantly and utterly destroyed — even if it still has Essence, it does not retreat into hibernation, it is simply gone.\
Short of archmastery, this spell cannot affect spirits of Rank 6 or higher.
