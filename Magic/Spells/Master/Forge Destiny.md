- The mage grants the subject a Supernatural Merit for which she qualifies with a maximum rating equal to the spell’s Potency. Sanctity of Merits doesn’t apply to the loss of this Merit.
- The mage increases or decreases the subject's rating in a Supernatural Merit by dots equal to Potency
- The mage imposes [[Aspirations]] and [[Obsessions]] on the subject equal to Potency, replacing ones chosen by the Storyteller
- The mage chooses the subject’s Doom. This can affect subjects who don’t have the [[Destiny Merit]]
