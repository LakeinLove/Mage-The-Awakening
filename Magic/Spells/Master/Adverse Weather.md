_The mage summons a major weather system as severe as a tornado, tsunami, monsoon, or hurricane._

The weather effects take hold in minutes and dissipate immediately once the spell expires.

This allows the mage to create Extreme Environments of nearly any kind up to Level 4, as per Control Weather, but without the limitations.

She does not have to call up disasters; she can make a rainstorm appear in a cloudless blue sky if she desires.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage can create weather drastically different from the local conditions, such as a monsoon during the savannahâ€™s dry season.
