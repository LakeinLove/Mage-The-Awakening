_Where adepts of Prime can create platonic objects by forcing [[Mana]] into the pattern it wears within tass, a master can create the complex Prime patterns within living beings and the environment._

---

When fuelled with [[Mana]], this spell creates an obviously-magical construct much like Platonic Form, except that the construct is not limited to single physical objects.\
Eidolons may imitate fire, fog, and even entire environments, but most masters use it to create “living” constructs.

Eidolons are still made of solidified [[Mana]], and have Durability and Structure instead of [[Health]], and when mimicking environmental hazards do not inflict damage as they do (Eidolon fire does not burn, for example).\
They follow the Potency rules for Platonic Form, but Potency may also be allocated to grant dots of the [[Retainer]] Merit.

Though animate, the construct is mindless. If used as a [[Retainer]], the Eidolon’s “field” includes simple physical labour, combat, and other uncomplicated tasks. The Eidolon can only execute whatever order the caster gave it last.\
Orders must be very simple. If attacked, the Eidolon has no [[Defence]].

Unlike Platonic forms, Eidolons do not crumble when all [[Mana]] is withdrawn. A mage may “refill” the construct with the Channel [[Mana]] spell or similar effects.\ When the spell’s Duration runs out, any unused [[Mana]] sublimates back into the world and is lost.

**Add [[Forces]] •••:** The construct is not obviously magical.

**Add [[Mind]] •••••:** The tass may be given a mind of its own.
