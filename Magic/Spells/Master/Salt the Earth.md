_This destructive spell rips the very life-force from an area or an individual, rendering it incapable of sustaining life._

---

Plants, animals, and even fungi in the area die.

The use of this spell even temporarily halts decomposition in an area based upon microbial breakdown of dead cells, as it kills all microscopic organisms as well.\
Finally, the spell prevents anything affected from becoming fertilized, though existing pregnancies stay if the organism survives. 

The spell creates an Extreme Environment effect equal to Potency.

**+1 Reach:** Individual living things that survive the assault on their vitality will find themselves unable to grow or heal naturally, and suffer an additional â€“1 from any wound penalties they currently bear.
