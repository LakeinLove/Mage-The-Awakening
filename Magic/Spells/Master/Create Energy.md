_The mage creates energy from nothing within a subject or area of effect._

---

She can create light (including sunlight), fire, radiation, sound, and electricity.

Use the Transform Energy table as an example of the levels she can create within the affected area.

For fire, assume the heat is:
- +1 for Potency 1–2
- +2 for Potency 3–4
- and +3 for Potency 5+

After creating the energy, she can modify it with Control spells.

Creating radiation also creates an Extreme Environment hazardous to living beings.
