_By means of this spell, the mage creates a Locus at a location with the Resonant Condition._

---

A Locus is a location in which the Shadow world is especially close.

Spirits don’t need the Reaching Manifestation Effect to use their powers across the Gauntlet at a Locus, attempts to cross over are at +2 dice, and spirits whose natures match the Locus’ Resonant Condition heal at twice the normal rate.

**+1 Reach:** The Locus generates a number of Essence per day equal to the spell’s Potency.
