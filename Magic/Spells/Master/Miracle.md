_This spell causes events to unfold according to the mage’s dictates._

---

The mage receives a number of Intercessions equal to Potency, which she may use as a reflexive action during the spell’s Duration. 

Spending one Intercession can achieve the following, affecting a single subject within sensory range:
- Increase the number of successes on a roll by one after the dice are rolled.
- Decrease the number of successes on a roll by one after the dice are rolled. If this reduces the number of successes to less than zero, a dramatic failure results.
- Cause a reasonably likely event to happen immediately and conveniently for the mage. An old man suffers a heart attack. A car hits a pedestrian on the sidewalk.

**+1 Reach:** Spend one Intercession and one Willpower to bring about a low-probability event. Lightning hits someone standing on the roof during a storm. Doctors bring a patient back from the edge of death using an experimental medical procedure.

**+2 Reach:** Spend one Intercession, one Willpower, and one Mana to achieve the incredible. This doesn’t make the impossible possible, but virtually any event with a mundane, real-world precedent is fair game. A spark causes a car to explode at a gas station. A man falls out of a plane and survives without any major injuries.
