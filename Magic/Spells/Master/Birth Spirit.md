_The most fearsome spell in most shamans’ arsenal, this terrible magic utterly destroys a spirit._

---

By means of this spell, the mage may coax dormant Essence into life, awakening it as a Rank 1 Spirit.

This spirit is not under the mage’s particular control, but most newborn spirits feel a kind of respect or gratitude toward their maker.\
Many mages then use Bolster Spirit and Shape Spirit to improve their ephemeral creation’s capabilities.

**+1 Reach:** For one Mana, the Spirit created is Rank 2.
