_The mage creates an object out of nothing._

---

The object may be any simple tool or relatively uncomplicated machine (a revolver qualifies, but an automatic handgun is too complex).

The object’s size is determined by the Scale factor.\
The spell’s Potency may be allocated as the mage wishes between Durability or equipment bonus.

**+1 Reach:** Create a complex machine or electronic device, like a car or a smartphone. The device must still be something that operates according to known physical principles: no teleporters or warp drives.
