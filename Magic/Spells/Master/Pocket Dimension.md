_The mage creates a space outside of space, one ideally suited to serve as a sanctum — or a prison._

---

Without the addition of other [[Arcanum|Arcana]], this space is devoid of any identifiable features, dimensions, or boundaries.\
It has no [[Time]], so anything within it is held in stasis, un-aging (but also un-healing and never growing or improving).\
It has no [[Death]] or [[Spirit]], so Twilight doesn’t exist within it. It is, in essence, a space whose only definition is that it is a space.\
Someone within the dimension can walk forever in any direction, but when she turns back she finds herself only as far as the boundary of the spell’s Area Factor.

The Pocket Dimension is divorced from physical reality; unless the mage chooses to anchor the realm to a point in the world, the only way to reach it is to teleport there.\
Spells cast within the Pocket Dimension do not incur [[Paradox]], unless they are cast sympathetically on someone outside the Pocket Dimension.\
The mage counts as a material [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] Yantra for her own Pocket Dimension.

If the Pocket Dimension is ever destroyed, or if its Duration expires, everything inside reappears in the world at the exact location from which it or they entered the Dimension.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may create an Iris to the Pocket Dimension in the material realm, allowing anyone to enter and leave it. For an additional Reach, she may specify a [[Keys|Key]] for the Iris.

**Add [[Time]] ••:** [[Time]] flows normally within the pocket dimension, matching the flow of [[Time]] in the material realm. Wise mages supplement this conjunction with [[Matter]] spells or similar effects to ensure a continuous air supply.

**Add [[Death]] ••, [[Mind]] ••, or [[Spirit]] ••:** The Pocket Dimension includes Twilight for entities attuned to the [[Arcanum]] added.
