_This spell severs the world’s connection with the Supernal, creating a “dead zone” in which the energies of life simply cease to be._

---

By defining all truths, the Supernal includes the means of its own erasure.

The spell has the following effects:
- Ley Lines within the area dry up and die. Nodes similarly cease to function.
- Hallows whose rating is less than the spell’s Potency fall dormant.
- Sleepers who spend more than a day within the area gain the Enervated condition (This is not soul-loss and victims do not progress further)
- Any attempt to reawaken a Hallow within the area adds the Potency of this spell to the Hallow’s dot rating for purposes of Withstanding the effect.

**+2 Reach:** The effects are Lasting, though without major geomantic workings to maintain the barren state, within a month or so natural rhythms will reassert themselves and Ley Lines, Nodes, and the health of the Sleepers will return. Hallows, however, remain dormant.
