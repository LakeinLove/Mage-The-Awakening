_This spell severs the world’s connection with the Supernal, creating a “dead zone” in which the energies of life simply cease to be._

---

By defining all truths, the Supernal includes the means of its own erasure.

The spell has the following effects:
- [[Ley Lines and Nodes|Ley Lines]] within the area dry up and die. [[Ley Lines and Nodes|Nodes]] similarly cease to function.
- [[Hallows]] whose rating is less than the spell’s Potency fall dormant.
- [[Sleepers]] who spend more than a day within the area gain the [[Enervated]] condition (This is not soul-loss and victims do not progress further)
- Any attempt to reawaken a Hallow within the area adds the Potency of this spell to the Hallow’s dot rating for purposes of [[Withstanding Magic|Withstanding]] the effect.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** The effects are Lasting, though without major geomantic workings to maintain the barren state, within a month or so natural rhythms will reassert themselves and [[Ley Lines and Nodes|Ley Lines]], [[Ley Lines and Nodes|Nodes]], and the health of the [[Sleepers]] will return. [[Hallows]], however, remain dormant.
