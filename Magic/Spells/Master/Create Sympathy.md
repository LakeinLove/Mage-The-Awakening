_To a Master of Space, powerful connections are forged as easily as snapping one’s fingers._

With this spell, the mage creates a new [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] connection on the subject.

These new connections are Lasting, but can fade with time.

**+1 Reach:** The [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] connections created are Lasting, and will never fade. Only magic can sever them. This can have dramatic, long-term psychological repercussions on a subject, as he is effectively never able to emotionally let go.

**+2 Reach:** The mage may apply a new name to the subject, which does not replace the original. This effect is not Lasting, and fades when the spell’s Duration ends.
