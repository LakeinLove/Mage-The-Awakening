_The master lives among her shadow brethren in a palace of her will._

This spell carves out an extradimensional space in the Shadow, one of the fabled “Places That Aren’t” that doesn’t map to any location in the physical world.\
The Spirit Manse can take any form the mage desires, but its appearance is heavily coloured by her Path and her Nimbus. As long as the spell’s Duration lasts, the mage gains the Safe Place Merit at a rating equal to the spell’s Potency.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage may create an Iris between her Manse and the material world, allowing anyone to enter the Shadow directly into her Manse. She may craft a [[Keys|Key]] to this door if she wishes. The spell becomes Withstood by the Gauntlet Strength.
