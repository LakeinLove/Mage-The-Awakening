_The mage sends out a call to the nearest spirit within her sensory range._

Conversely she can summon spirits she knows personally.

She may send a general call and the nearest spirit will answer, or she can specify the type of spirit by Resonance. The spell does not work on spirits above Rank 5.

**+1 Reach:** The spell also creates the Open Condition on the area, even if it does not match the spiritâ€™s Resonance.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may give the spirit a single, one-word command to follow. The spirit is not compelled to complete a task if it cannot finish the command before the Duration of the spell elapses.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may summon spirits from across the Gauntlet. If she is in the vicinity of an open Iris to the other side, the spell functions as normal. If not, the spell is Withstood by the greater of Rank or the Gauntlet Strength. Spirits may only cross the Gauntlet if they have the ability to do so.

**+2 Reach:** The mage may give the spirit a complex command to follow. The command must be a single task, but the mage can describe the task within a sentence or two.
