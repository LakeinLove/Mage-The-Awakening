_The mage may improve the subject’s Physical Attributes._

---

The spell increases Strength, Dexterity, or Stamina (chosen when the spell is cast) by its Potency. This increase affects any Advantages or other traits derived from the [[Attribute]]’s level.

The effects are subtle in appearance; the affected target doesn’t grow or gain any obvious muscle mass, but observers can detect even subtle hints of changes to balance, strength, or stamina.

The affected [[Attribute]] cannot be raised above the subject’s maximum [[Attribute]] dots (5 for normal human beings).

**+1 Reach:** The spell affects an additional [[Attribute]], dividing the spell’s Potency between both. This effect may be applied twice to affect all three Attributes.

**+1 Reach:** By spending a point of Mana, the mage may raise an [[Attribute]] above the maximum rating for the subject.
