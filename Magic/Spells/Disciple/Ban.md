_In the quest for self-knowledge, it is sometimes useful to cut oneself off from the outer world so that one can understand that the world is contained within._

By means of this spell, the mage inverts an area of space, such that nothing inside the space can get out and nothing outside the space can get in. Try to step in and you find yourself on the far side, carried in a single step.\
Try to get out and you’re just stepping right back in again.\
Magic that manipulates space, like a teleportation power or the ability to step from one world to another, provokes a [[Clash of Wills]] to allow ingress or egress.

Even light and air can’t pass through: From the outside, the space appears to “lens” as the observer approaches it, as light jumps directly across the Ban. From inside, it’s an island of light in a vast sea of darkness.

**Add Any [[Arcanum]] ••:** Either exclude one or more phenomena under the [[Arcanum]]’s purview from the spell (for example, to let air or light through) or create a Ban that only prohibits phenomena under that [[Arcanum]]’s purview.
