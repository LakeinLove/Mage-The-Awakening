_The mage may telepathically enter her subject’s subconscious._

---

She may pull memories and ideas out of the subject’s subconscious, instead of just reading surface thoughts (see Telepathy)

**+1 Reach:** As above, but now the mage is capable of modifying a single memory she has read from the subject’s subconscious mind. She may add to, delete, or change the memory to suit her needs; and the changes last until the spell’s Duration ends. For example, the mage could make someone forget where she parked her car, remember having met the mage at her wedding, or think her favourite ice-cream flavour is vanilla instead of strawberry.
