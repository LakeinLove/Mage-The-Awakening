_The mage is capable of temporarily increasing one of her subject’s Skills._

---

She can increase one Skill that the subject already has at least one rank in by one dot per level of Potency of the spell. The spell cannot increase the subject’s Skill above the normal maximum.

+1 Reach: The mage may increase an additional Skill with the spell per additional Reach spent, dividing the spell’s Potency among them. The Skill must still be one that the subject already has at least one rank in. For example, a mage can spend +2 Reach with a Potency 3 spell to increase the subject’s Subterfuge by +1, Stealth by +1 and Medicine by +1.

+ 2 Reach: By spending a point of Mana, the mage may increase her subject’s Skills above the normal maximum allowed.
