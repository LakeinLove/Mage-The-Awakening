_This spell allows a mage to swiftly superimpose pieces of various objects into one another in such a way as to produce a desired result._

With this spell, a mage could, for example, integrate a nail-gun and shotgun together to produce a weapon that fires a barrage of nails with each pull of the trigger.

For each level of Potency, the mage may transpose one quality (such as a rotisserie’s generation of heat or its ability to rotate another object within it) from a given mechanical object onto another mechanical object. In the case of combining firearms with other firearms, one weapon characteristic can be swapped out for another (creating a pistol, for example, that uses shotgun shells for ammunition).

A firearm can also be incorporated fully into another device, effectively disguising the weapon until it is first used (or it undergoes close mystic or mundane inspection).

**Add [[Life]] (•••):** The machine properties can be grafted onto a living thing, or vice versa. The mage might, for example, make a bird that can breathe fire or a butane torch that can fly
