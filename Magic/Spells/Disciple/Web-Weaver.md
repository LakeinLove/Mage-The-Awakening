_We all leave tiny, nigh-imperceptible webs of [[Sympathy]] behind us wherever we go. With this spell, the mage may bolster such a web into a useful [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] link._

Each level of Potency bolsters a single [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] connection by one “step,” from Weak to Medium, Medium to Strong. The mage can step up a non-existent connection to a Weak one, but only if the subject of the spell has been in contact with the desired focus within the last turn.\
For example, a person likely has no [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] connection to the soda cup from her lunch, but as long as it’s in her hand, the mage can use the faint [[Sympathy]] created by physical contact to make the cup a [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] connection.

**Add [[Time]] ••:** The mage can employ Temporal [[Sympathy]] to bolster non-existent connections to anything the subject touched in the target time.
