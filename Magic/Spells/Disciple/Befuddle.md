_The mage lowers one of her subject’s Mental or Social Attributes._

---

Each level of Potency reduces one of the subject’s Social or Mental Attributes by one dot, to a minimum of 1.\
Lowering Attributes also reduces any derived Advantages, such as Willpower or Initiative.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may decrease an additional Mental or Social [[Attribute]] for each additional Reach spent, dividing the Potency of the spell among them.
