_The mage is capable of increasing the subject’s mental or social capacity._

---

The mage can increase one of either the subject’s Mental or Social Attributes by one dot per level of Potency of the spell. This increase affects any Advantages or other traits derived from the [[Attribute]]’s level.\
The spell cannot increase the subject’s [[Attribute]] above her normal maximum allowed by her [[Gnosis]].

The benefits of this spell are not obvious to a casual observer, but those who know the subject may notice an increase in her intellect or charismatic nature.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage may increase an additional [[Attribute]] with the spell for each additional[[Reach]], dividing the spell’s Potency among them. For example, the mage may spend +2[[Reach]] with a Potency 4 spell and increase the subject’s [[Intelligence]] by +1, [[Resolve]] by +2, and [[Wits]] by +1.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** By spending a point of [[Mana]], the mage may increase her subject’s Mental or Social Attributes above the normal maximum allowed.
