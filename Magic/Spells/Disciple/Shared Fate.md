_Fate is an instrument of both justice and punishment. This spell braids the fates of two subjects together. Whatever befalls one subject affects the other._

---

Whenever one subject suffers damage, a [[Tilts|Tilt]], or an unwanted Condition, any others suffer it as well. If Scale is not increased when casting this spell, the mage herself is treated as a subject.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The link instead only works one way for one of the subjects â€” such that the subject suffers harm inflicted on the others but not the reverse.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** The subject is not linked to the mage or any other specific subject. Instead, she suffers any damage, [[Tilts|Tilt]], or unwanted Condition she inflicts, regardless of whom she harms.
