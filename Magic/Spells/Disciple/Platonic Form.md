_The mage may pattern [[Mana]] into behaving as it does within tass, creating a magical object formed of pure [[Mana]]._

---

The object must be a simple object or tool (swords and gemstones are allowable, guns and cars are not).

It is obviously magical to onlookers, has a default Durability of 1 and consists of one point of [[Mana]] (which the mage must pay as part of the casting).\
Potency may be allocated to the following effects:
- Increase Durability by +1
- Increase [[Mana]] capacity by +1 (the mage may fill this [[Mana]] capacity by spending [[Mana]] as part of the casting or leave the object partially empty)
- If the object can be used as a tool or weapon, add +1 equipment bonus or weapon damage. Each action using the construct as a tool or weapon uses up 1 [[Mana]] from its supply

When all [[Mana]] is withdrawn from the object, it crumbles to nothing. A mage may “refill” it with the Channel [[Mana]] spell or similar effects.\
When the spell’s Duration runs out, any unused [[Mana]] sublimates back into the world and is lost.

**Add [[Forces]] •••:** The object is not obviously magical.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** If the object is a tool, it is a perfected ideal of that tool. It grants 8-Again.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** The [[Mana]] construct can be a complex device.
