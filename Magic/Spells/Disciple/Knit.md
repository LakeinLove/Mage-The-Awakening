Each level of Potency heals two boxes of bashing damage.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** the spell heals one lethal damage per Potency instead of two bashing.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage may heal Personal Tilts such as Arm Wrack, forcing broken bones back into shape.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The spell heals damage done by deprivation and charges the subject’s system as though she had received a full meal and plenty of water.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The spell reproduces the effects of a full night’s rest in the subject, including regaining a point of Willpower if applicable.
