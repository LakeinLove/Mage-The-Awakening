_Structures decay, bodies age. Toxins build up in muscles, and materials become brittle. The mage can inflict these processes by Perfecting the passage of time on her subject._

This is an attack spell, inflicting its Potency in damage to objects and structures.

This damage directly affects the object’s Structure, and reduces its Durability by 1 for every 2 points of Structure lost.

When used against living things, the spell deals bashing damage equal to Potency.\
At the Storyteller’s discretion, immortal creatures like vampires might be immune to the damaging properties of this spell.

**+1 Reach:** The spell reduces living subjects’ Athletics by Potency through sheer exhaustion.
