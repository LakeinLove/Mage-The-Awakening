_The mage may step back through time a short distance, undoing a few precious seconds._

---

This spell sends the subject back through time a number of turns equal to Potency.

The subject retains any injuries and Conditions gained in the undone turns, and spent Mana and Willpower do not return. Spells cast on her person in the undone time remain as long as she cast them.\
All other spells she may have cast or had cast on her in the intervening time are cancelled. Until the subject catches up to the present, the distortion caused by this spell is visible under Active [[Time]] Mage Sight. Once she does so, any changes she made to history become Lasting.

**+1 Reach:** The subject travels back a full scene. This Reach effect may be applied multiple times.
