_The mage can conjure telekinetic force to lift or manipulate an object remotely._

---

Apply the spell’s Potency to one of the force’s Strength (raw lifting/pushing power), Dexterity (fine manipulation), or Speed. The other two default to 1.

Moving objects using Telekinesis requires concentration as an instant action each turn; if the mage fails to concentrate on moving the force, it simply hangs suspended, holding any objects it held before but no longer pushing or pulling (or manipulating objects, if used for that).\
The mage may then resume directing the telekinetic force until the spell’s Duration expires.

**+1 Reach:** The player may divide Potency among two of Strength, Dexterity, and Speed. This Reach may be performed twice.
