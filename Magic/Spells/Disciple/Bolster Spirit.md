Each level of Potency of this spell heals a spirit of two boxes of bashing damage.

**+1 Reach:** In lieu of healing damage, the mage may expend one Potency to increase one of the spirit’s Attributes by +1 for the Duration of the spell. The spirit’s Rank-derived Attribute maximum still applies.

**+2 Reach:** The mage may spend one Mana to increase the spirit’s Rank by 1, increasing its maximum Attribute levels and Essence pool, as well as awarding it one new Numen.
