_With a gesture the mage can conjure lightning down from a stormy sky to strike her foes._

---

She must use this spell with an existing storm or one she sets into motion with Control Weather, since she cannot create lightning from nothing at this level.

While the lightning bolt itself is all but unavoidable, the crackling build-up of energy gives a target warning.

The bolt can only strike a target it could actually reach, so the target must be exposed in some way.

With multiple subjects, the lightning forks, striking each simultaneously. It does damage according to the Electricity rules.
