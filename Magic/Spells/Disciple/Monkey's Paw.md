_The mage interacts with a lifeless object, bringing fortune to bear on it and making it a tool of destiny. The mage either blesses or curses the object._

---

The object’s equipment bonus is increased or decreased by the spell’s Potency, which may cause it to become a dice penalty if moved below zero.\
The spell may not cause the bonus or penalty to exceed five dice.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** If the object is blessed, anyone who carries, touches, or uses it also receives the benefits of a [[Boons|Boon]]. If the object is cursed, this user suffers a [[Hexes|Hex]].

**+1 [[Reach]]:** By spending a point of [[Mana]], the bonus or penalty may exceed five dice.
