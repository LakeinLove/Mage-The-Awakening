_The symbol-forms of the [[Aether]] are real enough to cut through all layers of reality. This spell enchants the subject to be as solid to [[Twilight]] entities as to physical matter._

---

This spell is equally effective against all forms of [[Twilight]]; the subject may interact with ghosts, spirits, angels, and stranger things with equal facility.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** If the enchanted object is a weapon, it may be enchanted to act as the bane of a specified being in [[Twilight]] for one [[Mana]]. Extra subjects may be added with the Scale [[Spell Factors|spell factor]], but each costs one extra point of [[Mana]].
