_This spell attracts misfortune to the subject or makes an already injurious situation considerably worse._

The next time the subject suffers at least one point of damage during this spell’s Duration, increase the damage he suffers by the spell’s Potency.

A glancing blow instead crushes a bone, for example. The damage type is the same as that of the original source of harm. This affects a maximum number of attacks equal to Potency during the spell’s Duration.
