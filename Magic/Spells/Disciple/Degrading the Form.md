This spell replicates those effects, crippling the subject’s Physical Attributes.\
Each level of Potency reduces Strength, Dexterity, or Stamina by one, chosen when the spell is cast, to a minimum of 1.

**+1 Reach:** The spell affects an additional Attribute, dividing the spell’s Potency between both. This effect may be applied twice to affect all three Attributes.
