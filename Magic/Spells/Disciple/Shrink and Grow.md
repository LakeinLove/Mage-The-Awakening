_By means of this spell, the mage may bring an object’s Supernal reflection closer to the world or push it farther away._

---

This in turn causes the Supernal to cast a larger or smaller shadow into the Fallen World, effectively making the object grow or shrink.

Each level of Potency either adds or subtracts one from the subject’s Size.\
Size 0 objects can be shrunk down to roughly the size of a dime.

**Add [[Life]] •••:** The spell can affect living subjects. Unwilling subjects may Withstand with Stamina.
