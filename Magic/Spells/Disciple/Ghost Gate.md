_The mage creates a two-dimensional plane that acts as a gateway, converting anything that moves through it into Twilight_

---

While in Twilight, the person can interact with and see [[Death]]-attuned ephemeral objects and beings.\
Items can be carried through the gate, but doing so destroys their material forms, though they may be retrieved later with “Touch of the Grave.”

**+1 Reach:** The mage is able to transform her subject into the Twilight state without the use of the gate. All of her clothes and personal possessions turn into ephemera as she makes the transition.
