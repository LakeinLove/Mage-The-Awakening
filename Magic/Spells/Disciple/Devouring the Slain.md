_The mage may pull the energy from his subject’s suffering into himself_

---

The mage chooses at the time of casting to either harvest [[Willpower]] or to scourge the subject’s Pattern for [[Mana]]. 

The subject must have at least one [[Health]] box filled with either lethal or aggravated damage.\
For each level of Potency, the mage may take one point of [[Willpower]] (up to the subject’s remaining [[Willpower]] points), or he may Scour the subject’s Pattern for one point of [[Mana]], dealing one lethal damage in the process, causing existing wounds to open and fester. 

Using this spell counts towards the limit of times per day a mage can gain [[Mana]] through Scouring.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage may affect a healthy subject with this spell instead of one who has recently taken damage. 

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The spell does not count toward the limit of times per day a mage can gain [[Mana]] through Scouring.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage may affect a ghost with this spell, damaging its Corpus to gain either [[Willpower]] or [[Mana]] on a one for one basis. The mage must choose when casting the spell to take either [[Willpower]] or [[Mana]], and cannot take a mix of the two from the ghost.
