_The mage bolsters a ghost, making low-Ranked ghosts more powerful and aware than they once were._

Each level of Potency raises one of the ghost’s three Attributes by one, not to exceed its Rank maximum.\
The mage can instead use the spell to heal a ghost’s Corpus at a rate of one point per Potency of the spell.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** The mage may spend one [[Mana]] to increase the ghost’s Rank by 1, increasing its maximum [[Attribute]] levels and Essence pool, as well as awarding it one new Numen.
