_The mage rips the soul from a Sleeper, casting it into Twilight_

---

While without a soul, the subject suffers from the Soulless Condition.

When the spell’s Duration ends, the Sleeper’s soul returns to him, unless otherwise prevented from escape, such as the case of being trapped in a soul jar or inside another body.

If this spell is cast on a subject who is already under the effects of the Soulless Condition, he is stepped up to the Enervated Condition — though the mage does not gain immediate access to his soul, since it is already missing.

**+1 Reach:** The subject’s soul leaves his body and enters Twilight, but he is instead under the effects of the Enervated Condition immediately, skipping the Soulless Condition. With an additional Reach, the subject can be placed under the effects of the Thrall Condition.
