_This spell allows the mage to redirect a target’s momentum._

---

Usually this forms a shield against projectiles, but it can be used on larger objects, as well. When a mage could use her Defence against an object, she may use this spell instead to redirect it as an instant action.\
If cast with a prolonged Duration, the mage may take a Dodge action each turn and use this spell instead of receiving the normal benefits for Dodging.

The spell allows the mage to turn a number of moving objects up to Potency.\
She does not have fine control over where each object is deflected, and the spell cannot make objects reverse direction entirely, only veer off target.

The maximum Size of a redirected object is determined by the spell’s Scale factor.\
Because the spell acts upon an object’s momentum and not the object itself, the weight and speed are irrelevant to this spell’s effect; if the mage can use the spell, the magic will thwart any object within its parameters.

The redirected object maintains all its original momentum.

By default, the Storyteller determines a random direction for the object to travel when redirected.

**+1 Reach:** The mage can use Turn Momentum’s effect as a Reflexive Action instead.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may control where the object is redirected to, as long as it is within 90 degrees of the original arc in any direction.

**+2 Reach:** The object’s momentum can be fully reversed. Thrown and Ranged weapons strike their users.

**Add Time •:** With Time 1 and a Reach, the mage can turn objects too fast for her target to gain Defence against them.
