_The mage confuses her subjectâ€™s senses, making him believe she is someone else._

---

She can invent an appearance, or mimic the exact look, sound, and smell of any individual she knows.

Unless the mage has interacted extensively with the person she is impersonating, she must make a Manipulation + Subterfuge roll when she first begins interacting with her subject, and every minute she continues interacting with him.

The spell cannot mimic specific Social Merits that grant dice bonuses to Social rolls.

If the mage opens any Doors, or makes any new first impressions, the progress benefit goes to the person she is impersonating, not herself.
