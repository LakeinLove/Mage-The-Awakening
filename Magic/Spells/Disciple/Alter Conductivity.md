_With this spell, the mage alters a subject’s base properties, changing the manner in which it conducts electricity._

---

This spell can automatically shut down any electrical device whose power isn’t great enough to inflict damage, or it can increase or decrease the amount of electricity that can flow through the object.

For each level of Potency, the spell allows the object to conduct two points worth of electrical damage, or reduces electrical damage by two.

The object must still be in contact with an appropriate source of electricity to deal this damage; even a Potency 6 spell won’t let the power from a household wall outlet inflict more than four points of bashing damage (See Electricity).

Reducing electrical damage to zero also shuts electrical devices down — for example, completely snuffing a subway rail’s conductivity shuts the trains down.

**+1 Reach:** The mage can alter the subject’s ability to transmit other forms of energy, such as heat, sound, or even light. Each additional form of energy is an extra Reach.
