This spell allows the mage to either raise or lower the local Gauntlet Strength by an amount equal to the spell’s Potency within the spell’s Area.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The mage may alter the Gauntlet independently on either side. She might, for example, reduce the Gauntlet rating from the material side while raising it on the Shadow side.
