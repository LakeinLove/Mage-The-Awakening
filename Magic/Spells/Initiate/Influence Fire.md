_Legends of mages controlling fire begin with this spell, which allows a mage to guide the path of existing flames._

---

This lets her cause flames to arc or stretch, command them to burn along a particular path (or prevent them from another), or even form particular fiery shapes.

At this level the mage cannot increase the flames in size or intensity, though she could direct them into a source of fuel.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** By efficient use of fuel and direction, the mage can increase or decrease the size of a fire by one level (see Transform Energy table).
