_While her senses are open to this spell, the subject can clearly perceive Ley Lines and Nodes._

---

Depending on the caster’s Path and Nimbus, she might see them as beams of golden light meeting at shining Platonic solids, electric-blue rivers pooling into lakes, or strains of music building into a mighty symphony.

If there are no Ley Lines or Nodes within sensory range, the subject feels a tugging sensation toward the nearest Ley or Node.

**+1 Reach:** The mage’s perceptions expand to tell her when a node sits atop a Hallow.

**Add [[Death]] • or [[Spirit]] •:** The mage’s senses are also attuned to the presence of Avernian Gates or Loci, respectively. Other Arcana may reveal stranger sacred spaces, as well.
