_The mage knows just the perfect time to act, whether it’s with a kind (or condemning) word, a punch, or even simply slipping out a door at the right time._

This spell does not directly alter time or affect others, but rather grants the subject a perfect temporal assessment of the situation. Others might describe her as “in the zone,” mistaking her preternatural sense of timing for incredible focus.

The subject can spend a turn during the spell’s Duration planning an action. The subject loses any Defence and must remain still while planning.\
A turn spent planning grants a bonus to the next action equal to Potency.\
This bonus can only be applied to mundane instant actions; extended actions and spellcasting rolls do not benefit from it.
