_This spell reveals the marks of Fate on people, places, and things the mage observes (up to one subject per turn)._

In addition to allowing the mage to detect any sympathetic connections between the subjects, the mage can also identify those who have violated a magical oath, and the presence of spells with conditional Durations.

**+1 Reach:** The mage can also detect possession, supernatural mind control, and alterations of destiny.

**+2 Reach:** The mage can also discern specific information about a subject’s destiny — such as the Doom of a subject with the Destiny Merit or the the parameters of a conditional Duration.
