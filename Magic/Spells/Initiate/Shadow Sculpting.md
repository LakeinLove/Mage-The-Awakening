_The mage can mould and shape the shadows in the area of effect._

---

He can shape the shadows into any likeness of his choosing. The area must have shadows present for the mage to shape them. 

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The caster can both change the shape of the shadows as well as animate them. Shadows move and flow at the mageâ€™s direction, at the same speed as the caster.
