_The mage can determine the health of a person’s soul._

---

She can determine one soul mark per Potency of the spell cast.\
She can discern the presence of Persistent Conditions, if the subject is Awakened, if the subject is a supernatural being, if the subject has created a Soul Stone, if the subject has had her soul tampered with, if the subject is Possessed, the presence of any Gnosis 5+ Legacy Attainments, if the subject has eaten or otherwise consumed another’s soul, or if the subject is suffering from a [[Paradox]] Condition.

**+1 Reach:** The mage can perform this spell on an unattached soul. Free of its host, a soul may also reveal if its former host had any Legacy Attainments at Gnosis 1–4.
