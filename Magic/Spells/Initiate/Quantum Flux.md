_The mage reads probability and compensates for deleterious factors, attracting small turns of good fortune to negate unfortunate obstacles that stand in her way._

This negates penalties to any of the subject’s actions equal to Potency for a number of actions during the Duration equal to Potency.

Additionally, the subject can spend a turn during the spell’s Duration aiming an action.\
The subject loses any Defence and must remain still while aiming. A turn spent aiming grants a bonus to the next action equal to Potency.

These effects can only be applied to mundane instant actions; extended actions and spellcasting rolls do not benefit.
