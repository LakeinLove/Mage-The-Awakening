_All Awakened magic contains the capacity to end, to allow the Fallen World’s laws to reassert themselves. By Compelling these flaws in an extant spell, the mage may temporarily suppress it — or even destroy it entirely_

This spell is not potent enough to dispel an archmage’s spells, and only works against Awakened magic. In addition, the mage must include all [[Arcanum|Arcana]] involved in the casting of the subject spell at one dot.

A successful casting suppresses the spell for the Duration of Dispel Magic.

**Add [[Fate]] •:** The mage may suppress the subject spell selectively, for a number of subjects equal to Dispel Magic’s Scale factor.

**+2 Reach:** For one point of Mana, the effect is Lasting. If the spell’s original caster is still alive and has not relinquished the spell, she knows one of her spells was destroyed.
