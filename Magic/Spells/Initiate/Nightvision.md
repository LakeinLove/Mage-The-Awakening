_Despite its name, the Nightvision spell enhances ambient light, fine-tunes the mage’s sense for vibrations and thermal changes, and grants her the power to see into the infrared and ultraviolet spectra._

She becomes able to intuitively feel as well as see forms of electromagnetic radiation, sound, and kinetic energies, allowing her to navigate without penalty in complete darkness.\
She can still see and make out details, even in the dark, although colours are somewhat muted.

This spell has the side effect of making the caster much more vulnerable to light; while in effect, she suffers no penalties from dim or even no lighting, but suffers penalties from bright lights as she normally would from darkness.\
Bright lights and extremely loud sounds can disorient or even inflict the Blind Condition on her for the spell’s Duration.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The spell automatically compensates for and allows the mage to ignore the deleterious effects of sudden extreme stimulus.
