_The mage can look into her subject’s most likely future._

---

Without Reach, the mage can only see generalities: “Will I meet Anna again soon?” is a valid question, while “What time will the police arrive?” is too specific to return an answer.

This spell can see far into the future, such as telling the mage that a young cashier might eventually become a state Governor, or that a child prodigy might become a superstar, but looking too far from the present increases the likelihood of the answer being superseded by the point the future becomes the present.

The Storyteller must decide what the future holds, taking into account the nature of the story as well as cues from the mage’s questions. The caster can ask one general question per level of Potency, receiving answers of “Yes,” “No,” or “Irrelevant.”

**+1 Reach:** The mage can ask more specific questions and receive mostly accurate answers. The answers need not come in the form of “Yes,” “No,” or “Irrelevant.” Instead the mage can ask questions like “Will Anna marry?” or “Will I ever bear a child?” and receive more information, such as “Anna will meet an old flame, Jason, and the two will reunite and one day marry.”
