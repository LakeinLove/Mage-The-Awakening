_The mage can operate or shut down electrical devices with magic._

---

With this spell she can only cause existing devices to work as they normally would when powered on, or when the power is shut off. For example, she could “hotwire” a car without actually needing to touch any wires, turn lights off and on, and cause industrial machinery to power up or turn off. 

This spell does not give her further control over these devices, but does allow her to engage or shut down devices that might otherwise require passwords or electronic keys.
