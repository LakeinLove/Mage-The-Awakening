_The mage can sense whether a subject will prove beneficial or baneful in the most likely future._

---

The mage can see whether the stranger crossing the street to approach her at night is as threatening as he seems, or whether he has come to offer advice, for example.

The spell itself does not tell the mage exactly what will happen, only whether it will prove good or bad for her. The stranger may augur as a bad omen for her; this could be due to his malicious intent — or maybe he’s running from some danger, or even carrying a cold.

Although often used to assess potential dangers, mages can cast this spell with themselves as the only subject, assessing whether their own actions will help or harm them.

Mages with [[Time]] •• may use the Temporal Sympathy Attainment to cast this spell on a subject in the past, but the spell still reveals positive or negative outcomes for the future. The spell is Withstood by temporal sympathy.

**+1 Reach:** When reacting to the information gained from this spell, the mage gains a bonus to Initiative equal to Potency.
