_By studying an object for one turn, the subject gains a complete understanding of the object’s intended function._

Under the craftsman’s eye, no tool is mysterious.

From a tool as simple as a hammer to an intricate puzzle box, the item’s intended purpose is plain to see.\
If the object has no purpose (for example, a simple rock), the spell reveals that too.\
Likewise, if something prevents the object from fulfilling its purpose (for example, a car missing its spark plugs can’t drive), the spell reveals the nature of the problem.

**+1 Reach:** The subject’s senses expand to an understanding of how to use the examined object. Not only does this reveal things like the combination to a safe or the solution to a puzzle, it grants the subject 8-Again on all actions made using the studied object for its intended purpose. Only the most recently studied object gains this benefit.

**+2 Reach:** As above, plus the spell reveals all potential uses of an object, fanned out in a vast array of Supernal symbols around the object. Focusing on a particular use might require a reflexive Wits + Composure roll for especially complex items.

**Add [[Fate]] •:** The mage names a particular task when casting the spell (e.g. “get leverage on Carruthers,” “translate the Codex Afire”). Any object that might help with that task seem to loom larger, to be more physically present, and are immediately obvious to the subject as soon as she lays eyes on them.
