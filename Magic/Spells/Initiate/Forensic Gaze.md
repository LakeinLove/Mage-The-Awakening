_The mage can determine the state of a corpse. She determines the exact method of its demise as well as exactly when it died._

---

For each level of Potency, the mage reveals contributing factors to the cause of death. For example, a man found burned in a car might have died from asphyxiation, but might have gotten that way because he was unconscious due to a head wound from crashing his car into a tree while driving drunk. 

**+1 Reach:** The mage can witness the final moments of the corpse’s life just leading up to death as though seeing through the corpse’s eyes. Each rank of Potency reveals a minute of time prior to the corpse’s demise.
