_Casting this spell allows the mage to hear infrasound and ultrasound frequencies beyond what human ears can normally perceive._

---

While active, she can hear sounds outside the normal frequency, from high-frequency (dog whistles, sonar) to low-frequency (the distant rumble of diesel engines, industrial sounds normally lost to humans in the noise).

Apply the spellâ€™s Potency as a dice bonus to relevant dice pools, such as rolls to avoid ambush.
