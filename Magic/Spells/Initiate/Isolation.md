_Boundaries and barriers are a lie, but it is sometimes useful to lie. This spell subtly warps space and distance around the subject, making empty spaces seem larger and more foreboding._

Crowds of people seem tightly packed together, an impenetrable wall of humanity.

Any attempt the subject makes to interact with other people costs 1 Willpower.\
