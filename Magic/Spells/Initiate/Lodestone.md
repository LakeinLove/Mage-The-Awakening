_The mage chooses a substance or type of object. As long as the spell remains active, those objects within the spell’s Area are drawn to the spell’s subject: Dropped coins bounce toward her, water flows in her direction as long as she’s standing downstream, and so on._

---

Unless the object is capable of moving under its own power, this spell can only nudge the object when an external force is imparted on it: a ball might roll across the floor, but a heavy book won’t fly off a table into the subject’s hand. (It might, however, tip and fall off a shelf if it was precariously balanced to begin with.)

Alternately, the mage can repel objects from the subject in the same fashion. This spell isn’t strong enough to deflect a weapon swung or fired with intent to harm, but it can certainly keep the mage dry in a rainstorm or keep a cloud of tear gas at bay.
