_The spirits know what causes them pain, and avoid it at all costs._

This spell forces a spirit to avoid its Bane even more assiduously than normal.

The spirit must spend a point of Willpower to even come within the area of influence of its Bane (described by the Area factor of the spell), and cannot touch it at all.\
If the spirit is already within the proscribed area and fails the roll, it must flee immediately. This spell does not affect spirits above Rank 5.
