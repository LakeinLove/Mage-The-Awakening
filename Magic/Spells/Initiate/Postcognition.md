_The mage can see into the past of a subject, witnessing events as though she were physically present to view them._

---

By default, the caster may only view Unchanged subjects, but with [[Time]] •• she may view the more distant past, in which case the spell is Withstood by temporal sympathy.

The mage views the subject in “real time” from a moment declared when casting until the Duration of Postcognition expires.\
While viewing the past, the mage loses all Defence and may not take any actions or cast further spells.

**+1 Reach:** The mage can “scrub” the vision like a video, speeding it up, slowing it down, rewinding it, pausing it, etc.

**+1 Reach:** The mage remains aware of her surroundings, and does not lose Defence.
