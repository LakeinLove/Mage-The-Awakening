_This spell grants the mage a momentary glimpse of all the potential roads her destiny may follow to her desired destination, which allows the mage to identify the next step she must take to accomplish a stated objective._

Upon casting, the mage receives a clear omen that suggests a course of action that will lead her closer to her goal. This seldom guarantees immediate success, especially if the task before her is complicated, but can provide an important breakthrough.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** When the mage’s player makes a roll to achieve her stated goal she may substitute any Skill of the same type (Mental, Physical, or Social) as the one that the task calls for. Through some twist of fate Streetwise turns out to be just as useful in a specific social situation as Empathy, for example. This affects a number of rolls no greater than the Potency of the spell.

**+2 [[Reach]]:** As above, but the mage’s player may substitute any Skill. The mage’s street sense (Streetwise) so impresses a punk-at-heart librarian that she helpfully answers all his questions about Greek history (Academics), for example.
