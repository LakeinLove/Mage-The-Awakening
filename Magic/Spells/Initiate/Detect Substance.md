_The mage chooses a number of substances or objects that fall under Matter’s purview equal to the spell’s Potency. As long as this spell is active, the subject is automatically aware of the presence and location of the chosen substance within the area of effect._

The chosen substance can be as broad or as specific as the mage likes (“ferrous metal,” “stainless steel,” “a knife,” and “my hunting knife” are all valid options).

**Add Time •:** The subject can detect whether the chosen substance has been in the area within an amount of time equal to the spell’s Duration.

**Add [[Forces]] •:** The subject can search for specific types of electronic information, such as digital audio, photographs, or text documents. Not only will the spell reveal which devices have the chosen file type on board, if she’s actually using the device the mage knows where on the device the files are stored.
