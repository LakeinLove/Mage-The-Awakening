_With a simple spell, the mage can “nudge” kinetic forces, enhancing a subject’s motion._

---

This spell allows the subject to run a little faster, jump a little further, or lift a little more, not by altering forces but by maximizing the subject’s kinetic energy use.

This has the following benefits:
- The subject gains a bonus on rolls to resist fatigue equal to Potency. Actions are less strenuous when moving so efficiently
- Add the caster’s Forces dots to the total distance covered on a jump, to the subject’s swimming and running [[Speed]], and to any climbing rolls.
