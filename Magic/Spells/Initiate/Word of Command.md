_Enchanted objects and long-lasting spells often have specific triggers or conditions that must be fulfilled before they will release their magic._

---

With this spell, a mage can bypass those conditions, freeing the magic to do that which it would.\
The object or spell immediately activates, exactly as though it were triggered by whatever normally triggers the effect.\
If an activation roll is normally required, treat the spell’s Potency as rolled successes.

If the subject spell requires [[Mana]] to activate, the mage must spend it from her own pool.

Without additional [[Arcanum|Arcana]], this spell can only trigger Supernal spells and objects tied to the Supernal World such as [[Artifact|Artifacts]] and Imbued Items.

**Add Any Other [[Arcanum]] •:** By adding the relevant [[Arcanum]], a mage can activate magical effects and objects created by other sources of power — [[Spirit]] to activate a fetish, [[Fate]] to trigger a faerie’s curse, and so on. If this object requires mystical energy (Essence or stranger substances) to activate, the mage may spend [[Mana]] in lieu of the normal power source.
