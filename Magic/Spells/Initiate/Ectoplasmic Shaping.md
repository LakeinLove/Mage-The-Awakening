_The mage may shape and mould an ectoplasmic manifestation, either conjured by another mage or from a Materialized ghost, though the person or ghost that controls the ectoplasm may [[Withstanding Magic|Withstand]] the shaping._

---

After a successful casting, the mage shapes the ectoplasm into any shape he desires. The ectoplasm remains in the new shape for the Duration of the spell. He can use it to craft a mirror that reflects ghosts and other structures in ghostly Twilight in a given area.

Also, the mage can use the ectoplasm to create the Open Condition on an object or location for a ghost to Manifest through. Ghosts lose the Manifested Condition once the spellâ€™s Duration ends.
