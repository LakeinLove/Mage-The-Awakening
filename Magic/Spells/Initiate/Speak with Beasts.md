_The subject gains the ability to “speak” to any specimens of an animal specified by the mage during casting._

---

She usually speaks to it by making noises similar to its own sounds, but this is not necessary; the subject can speak in her own language and the magic “translates” her words for her.

This does not grant her any capability to control a creature, only to understand and be understood by it.

Animals have limited ability to understand things that transpire around them, especially as pertains to humans, but the subject gains a bonus to any Animal Ken rolls made with that animal equal to the spell’s Potency.\
A bird may not understand just why the people went into the house across the street last night, for example, but it could give a general estimate of their number and unusual features like being covered in tattoos ("skin patterns").

**+1 Reach:** The subject may communicate with all animals, instead of only a single species.
