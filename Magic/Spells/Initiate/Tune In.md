_A mage with this spell can listen to free-floating data transmissions, such as those broadcast by radios, cell phones, wireless modems, and more._

---

The magic translates this electromagnetic noise into something she can understand, although it preserves the original transmission language.

With this spell, the mage needs no receiver to listen or even see signals. Transmitting cables glow before her eyes with streams of data, while she might see a shimmer or even fleeting glimpses of images in the air.

Satellite internet and TV programming, closed walkie-talkies, CB broadcasts, and radio transmissions all become open to her senses, as well as wireless communications.
