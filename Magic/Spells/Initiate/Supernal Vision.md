_By opening her subject’s third eye, the mage reveals her fellows as the wells of Supernal power they are._

---

By studying a person, place, or location for one turn, the subject automatically knows whether it is connected to the Supernal (e.g. if a person is a mage, a Sleepwalker, a Proximus, or a [[Sleepers|Sleeper]]; if a place is a [[Verges and Demesnes|Demesne]] or [[Verges and Demesnes|Verge]]; if an object is Imbued, Enhanced, or an [[Artifact]]), and may ask a number of the following questions equal to the spell’s Potency:
- How much [[Mana]] does the target have in her Pattern?
- To which Supernal World is the target most closely aligned?
- What is the target’s highest-rated [[Arcanum]]? (Subsequent asking of this question reveals the target’s second, third, etc. highest [[Arcanum|Arcana]].)
- How adept is the target at their highest-rated [[Arcanum]]?
- How many [[Arcanum|Arcana]] does the subject know?
- What is the target’s [[Nimbus]]?
- What is the target’s [[Gnosis]]?

The subject perceives the answers as Supernal symbols and visions unfolding around the target. If the subject desires more information about a particular phenomenon, she may study it for multiple turns, as long as the spell’s Duration lasts.\
Effects that would cloak the target’s nature provoke a [[Clash of Wills]] as normal.

**+1 [[Reach]]:** The spell reveals the nature of supernatural beings and effects other than Supernal phenomena — though there’s no guarantee the mage knows what the aura of, for example, a Promethean looks like, and most of the questions will return nonsensical imagery that best translates as “not applicable.”
