_The benefits of initiation are many, from a connection to other Legacy members to the magical advantages of an altered [[Gnosis]]._

---

### Yantras

Initiates learn the Legacy’s [[Yantra|Yantras]].

Most require one turn to deploy and add +1 to spellcasting rolls. A few add +2 but either impose a disadvantageous [[Conditions|Condition]] or require rare materials, extra time, or special care.\
The required effort is part of the [[Yantra]], so sidestepping its disadvantages (by eliminating the stupor created by a sacred drug, for example) reduces its bonus accordingly.

### Oblations

Each Legacy also teaches Oblations that reflect its philosophy and legends.

Unlike ordinary Oblations, the mage does not need to perform Legacy Oblations at a Hallow — her soul becomes the “sacred place” being drawn upon. However, a mage away from a Hallow cannot gain more [[Mana]] per day than her dots in the Legacy’s Ruling Arcanum.

### Ruling Arcanum

Initiation into a Legacy confers an additional Ruling [[Arcanum]], set by the Legacy’s creators.

This normally raises an existing Common or Inferior [[Arcanum]] to Ruling Status, but in some cases the mage already possesses the Legacy [[Arcanum]] as a Ruling [[Arcanum]]. In this case, he develops an especially strong understanding of the [[Arcanum]]’s [[Mystery|Mysteries]]. Every time she learns a new dot in this [[Arcanum]] she earns an [[Arcane Experience]].

### The Mentor-Student Bond

Most Legacy tutors remain involved with their students long after first teaching the Legacy, creating a web of relationships that binds members together.

Through Legacy secrets and the teachings they specifically share, student and tutor have both shaped their [[Gnosis]] in the same fashion. Mentors and students have a Strong sympathetic link to one another.\
After a scene where they interact over some mystically meaningful or emotional and intimate matter, both earn an [[Arcane Beats|Arcane Beat]].\
This [[Beats|Beat]] can only be earned once per chapter (game session), even if the tutor interacts with multiple students, or the student is also a tutor, and meets with both teacher and pupil over a short period of time.

Legacy members without teachers don’t gain this benefit, and a student can’t choose a new Tutor if she can’t or won’t connect to the old one. Only the person who initiated her triggers the advantage. Note however that these interactions don’t have to be friendly ones, either.
