_The subtle Arcanum of the Primal Wilds deals with repercussions: What we do in this world has echoes that we cannot see or hear or feel, but which are no less real for all that._

---

## General Description

Spirit mages understand those repercussions, and know that it falls to them to act as intercessors between the Visible and the Invisible. Spirit’s purview is the Shadow Realm and its denizens, the spirits.\
The flows of Essence that empower them and the Gauntlet that holds them apart from our world also fall under this [[Arcanum]]’s dominion.

[[The Gauntlet]] is the membrane with which the Spirit [[Arcanum]] contends and interacts.
