_It is an identifier your character leaves on the things her [[Awakened]] [[Awakened Will|Will]] has touched. When she uses a spell, [[Praxis]], [[Rote]], or [[Attainment]], she leaves little wisps of her identity on that magic_

A mage utilizing [[Focused Mage Sight]] can recognize those signatures sheâ€™s seen before. If the signature comes from a particularly great [[Gnosis]] (6+), it offers a bonus to [[Revelation]] rolls regarding that [[Patterns|Pattern]].\
For every dot of [[Gnosis]] above five, add one die to relevant dice pools. By default, this lasts for a week. However, the bonus dice afforded by high [[Gnosis]] fade one per week instead. Once the last die is gone, it fades one week later.

A Signature Nimbus looks the part of a residue from or remainder of the [[Immediate Nimbus]]. If your character has a fiery [[Immediate Nimbus]], her Signature Nimbus might be charring and ash, for example. Or if her [[Immediate Nimbus]] causes intoxication, her Signature Nimbus might feel like a hangover.

If a mage wishes, she can imprint her Signature Nimbus on an object, place, or person at the cost of one [[Mana]]. In this case, add her [[Gnosis]] to any rolls to scrutinize that [[Nimbus]]. This fades at one bonus die per week. Spending a [[Willpower]] point turns those weeks into months.
