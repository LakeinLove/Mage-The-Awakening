_The Immediate [[Nimbus]] is a powerful aura directly surrounding the mage, wrapping close to her soul and flashing out as the Supernal World ebbs and flows against her._

---

When she casts a spell, her Immediate [[Nimbus]] becomes visible to those with any active [[Mage Sight]], regardless of the Arcana she’s using to cast. The Immediate [[Nimbus]] appears based mostly on the character’s [[Path]]. It’s a force, a halo of raw creation stuff. Sometimes, this is visible — sometimes it’s a sensation, a smell, or a muddy, primal emotion. 

Here are a handful of examples:\
For [[Thyrsus]], this might look like a mist of blood, or might cause a deep rutting instinct.\
[[Moros]] might cause subtle rot around them, or melancholy.\
[[Obrimos]] bask in holy light, or cause remarkable inspiration.\
[[Acanthus]] appear as if time bends around them, or cause fatalism.\
[[Mastigos]] glow with a sickly green fire, or cause temptation to swell in onlookers.

When the Immediate Nimbus flares, it causes a [[Nimbus]] [[Tilt]] unique to your character, with a strength depending on what caused the flare. If the [[Nimbus]] flared because of a spell, use the spell’s Potency as the [[Nimbus]]’ strength, and the [[Tilt]] lasts for the spell’s [[Reach]] in turns or one turn at a minimum.\
Alternatively, once per scene a mage can force her immediate Nimbus to flare for a single turn without casting a spell by spending a [[Mana]].\
In this case, roll the character’s [[Gnosis]] and use successes as the [[Nimbus]]’ strength. Deliberate flares like this are visible even in the [[Fallen World]] and can therefore affect characters not using [[Mage Sight]], although [[Sleepers]] will suffer [[Quiescence]] after the [[Tilt]] ends.

Compare the [[Nimbus]] strength to any witness’s [[Resolve]]. If a character’s [[Resolve]] is equal to or lower than the [[Nimbus]] strength, the [[Tilt]] takes effect. If for whatever reason a character is aware of the effects, she can willingly submit to the [[Tilt]] regardless of her [[Resolve]]. 

Mages can pit their own [[Nimbus]] against the aura as per the [[Interactions with Other Auras]] rules. While characters without [[Mage Sight]] cannot see the aura, the subtle cues still affect them with the [[Tilt]]. This is almost always imperceptible, but some particularly clued-in witnesses may note when something’s awry.
