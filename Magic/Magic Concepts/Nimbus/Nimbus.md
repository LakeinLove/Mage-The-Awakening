_Every mage has a Nimbus — a spiritual signature heavily influenced by her [[Path]] and Legacy but as unique to her as her DNA. Whenever a mage casts a spell, her Nimbus flares, revealing her to any mage using his Sight_

A Nimbus is more than something revealed when the mage casts a spell.

Even after the mage’s spell fades, her Nimbus lingers on the subject like a fingerprint that can be traced to her by other mages.\
A mage may also deliberately reveal her Nimbus, even to [[Sleepers]], to impress or intimidate, although doing so provokes [[Quiescence]].

Finally, every mage’s Nimbus subtly twists the lives of everyone and everything connected to the mage and makes them more closely reflect her Nimbus.\
In order to isolate their Sleeping families and loved ones from the effects of their Nimbuses, most mages adopt [[Shadow Name|Shadow Names]].

Most supernatural beings in the world are possessed of an “aura,” a spiritual presence that tells those who are sensitive that the being is something else. [[Vampires]] have a predatory aura; [[Werewolves]] have a powerful, feral mien about them. Mages’ souls are wrapped in the stuff of the Supernal, marking them as glorious and terrifying.

This phenomenon, the Nimbus, is based on numerous factors including a mage’s [[Path]], [[Legacies|Legacy]], and other pieces of personal symbolism. Her [[Shadow Name]] and her magical tools can influence its appearance, for example. It’s wholly invisible except when spellcasting, and even then only to [[Mage Sight]] most of the time.

A Nimbus takes three forms:
- [[Long-Term Nimbus]]
- [[Immediate Nimbus]]
- [[Signature Nimbus]]
Each comes into play in different circumstances.

## Nimbus Tilt

As part of Nimbus creation, you must come up with a Nimbus [[Tilts|Tilt]], which comes into play when your character’s [[Immediate Nimbus]] flares.\
The [[Tilts|Tilt]] either penalizes or bolsters specific actions the subject undertakes. You get a number of bonus or penalty dice equal to half your character’s [[Gnosis]] (rounded up). These must be applied to a combination of penalized or benefitting [[Attribute|Attributes]] (or both). Alternatively, you can apply the effect to [[Skill|Skills]].\
A benefitted [[Skill]] also gains the 8-Again quality.\
A penalized [[Skill]] loses the 10-Again quality.

So for example, a mage that flares a distracting, wanton, bacchanal Nimbus and [[Gnosis]] 7 might give a –1 penalty to both [[Composure]] and [[Wits]] rolls, but a +2 bonus to [[Presence]] rolls until his Nimbus fades.

As your character’s [[Gnosis]] increases, so does the effect of her [[Immediate Nimbus]] [[Tilts|Tilt]].\
When [[Gnosis]] increases, you can completely rework the [[Tilts|Tilt]], re- designing it from the ground-up.
