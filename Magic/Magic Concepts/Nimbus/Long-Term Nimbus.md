_The Long-Term Nimbus is a series of subtle coincidences that surrounds a mage_

---

These are purely story-based effects, bits of strangeness that align with your character’s [[Path]].\
For example, around [[Thyrsus]], spirits are more likely to show up, strange pathogens might infect people, and likewise terminal diseases can vanish.\
[[Moros]] bring ghastly hauntings, decay, rust, and mechanical breakdowns.\
[[Obrimos]] cause religious revelation, extreme weather swings, or blackouts.\
[[Acanthus]] cause strange luck, lost memories to rise up, or visions of possible fates.\
[[Mastigos]] cause people’s fears to well up, and sometimes they see their internal devils. 

It’s important to note that the Long-Term Nimbus is not a controllable force; it’s just a matter of strange, fractal geometry in the universe. [[Patterns]] converge around your character. However, a character’s [[Gnosis]] determines its general Potency.

While subtle at first, it can become truly obvious at six or more dots of [[Gnosis]]. [[Wisdom]] determines the range of the [[Nimbus]]’ effects, as it spreads along your character’s [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] ties (p. 173). At the Enlightened [[Wisdom]] tier, your character’s [[Nimbus]] is left on Strong connections. At Understanding level, Medium connections. At Falling level, on even Weak connections.
