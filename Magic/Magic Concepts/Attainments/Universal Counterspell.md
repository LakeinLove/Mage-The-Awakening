_An Apprentice of Prime understands the formation of spells and the creation of an Imago well enough to attack it on a direct, metaphysical level, allowing her a great deal more defensive capability._

The mage may use [[Counterspell]] on any Awakened spell.

The player rolls [[Gnosis]] + [[Prime]] when the character does not know the [[Arcanum]] used, or when this would be a higher dice pool than the appropriate [[Arcanum]].\
The mage may also spend a point of [[Mana]] to Counter a spellâ€™s lowest [[Arcanum]] rather than its primary [[Arcanum]].

For example, a mage with this [[Attainments|Attainment]] Countering a [[Fate]] 4, [[Space]] 2 spell may pay a point of [[Mana]] to roll the [[Clash of Wills]] against [[Gnosis]] + [[Space]] instead of [[Gnosis]] + [[Fate]].
