_Attainments are magical effects, similar to spells but not subject to the same rules. They allow a mage to employ meta-magical effects in order to improve the efficacy of her Arcana and change the world around her in lasting ways._

---

Attainments are available to all mages as their understanding of magic (as measured by the Arcana) increases. 

As a mage’s rating in an Arcanum increases, she gains access to new Attainments. The Orders instruct their members on how to use these abilities, but the instruction bears more resemblance to conditioning in athletics or fundamental principles in mathematics.

In game terms, Attainments use a variety of mechanics. Some are instant actions, some extended, and some don’t require dice at all. Many of them require the expenditure of Mana, or allow the mage to use Mana to boost their power and effectiveness.\
Attainments do not require Imagos and as such cannot be countered by [[Counterspell]], [[Universal Counterspell]], or any other Attainments that affect spells. Adding an Attainment to a spell, however, does not prevent it from being Countered.

### One-Dot Attainments

- [[Counterspell]]

### Two-Dot Attainments

_The second dot of an Arcanum grants a Lesser Utility Attainment and a form of Mage Armour._

Lesser Utilities are Attainments that fit into the purview of the Arcana, but don’t map to the Practices and rely more on a general understanding of the Arcanum in question than of specific spells.

Below are some of the most common Lesser Utilities, though the players and the Storyteller may devise others.

- [[Eyes of the Dead]]
- [[Conditional Duration]]
- [[Precise Force]]
- [[Improved Pattern Restoration]]
- [[Permanence]]
- [[Mind's Eye]]
- [[Universal Counterspell]]
- [[Sympathetic Range]]
- [[Spirit Eyes]]
- [[Temporal Sympathy Attainment]]
- [[Mage Armour]]

### Three-Dot Attainments

- [[Targeted Summoning]]

### Four-Dot Attainments

_Adepthood brings with it a Greater Utility Attainment. Greater Utilities, like the Lesser Utilities, are methods of using Arcana outside of the normal Practices._

- [[Inviolate Soul]]
- [[Unbound Fate]]
- [[Environmental Immunity]]
- [[Body Autonomy]]
- [[Durability Control]]
- [[Intuitive Leap]]
- [[Imbue Item]]
- [[Everywhere]]
- [[Honorary Rank]]
- [[Time in a Bottle]]

### Five-Dot Attainments

- [[Create Rote]]
