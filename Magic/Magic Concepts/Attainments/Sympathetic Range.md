_An Apprentice of Space can cast spells using her sympathy to a subject she cannot see._

---

The mage requires a sympathetic connection to the subject, and a [[Yantra]] symbolizing that subject to use as a focus for the spell.

To use this [[Attainments|Attainment]], the mage must be casting a spell at sensory range, use a sympathy [[Yantra]], and spend one Mana.\
The spell is Withstood by the fragility of the sympathetic connection, between the mage and her subject, but if the mage does not know the [[Sympathetic Name]] of the subject the [[Withstanding Magic|Withstand]] level increases by one.
