_An Adept of Spirit is sufficiently in control of her own interactions with ephemera that she, while still never a native, is at least not a stranger to [[The Shadow]]._

Spirits react to her presence with respect rather than naked hostility.

The character has an “honorary” spirit Rank equal to her dots in [[Spirit]]. Spirits sense her Rank as though she were a spirit, and her Physical attacks count as banes to spirits two Ranks or more below her.

She may spend a point of [[Mana]] to reduce a spirit’s Doors against her Social manoeuvring actions by one.
