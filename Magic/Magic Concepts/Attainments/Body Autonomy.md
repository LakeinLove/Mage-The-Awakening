_The mageâ€™s body is a temple, and cannot be altered, harmed, or affected without her consent._

---

Any incoming magical effect that would change her physical body can be immediately countered.

The mage can reflexively use this Attainment under the following circumstances:
- She is the target of a supernatural power that would alter her physical body in some way.
- She is the target of a supernatural power that would injure her.
- She is the target of an attack that would place a Personal Tilt on her (Arm Wrack, Blind, etc.).

The mage is immediately aware when one of the above circumstances applies, and may protect herself by spending a point of Mana.

The character enters a Clash of Wills with the intruding power, using her Gnosis + Life.
