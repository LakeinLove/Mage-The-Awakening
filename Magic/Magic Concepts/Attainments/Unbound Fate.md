_A mage with this level of proficiency with the intricacies of Fate has a sixth sense for powers intended to usurp control of his own destiny._

---

The mage can reflexively repel deleterious magic that will or could harm her fate. She can resist falling under the sway of a magical oath, for example, or shrug off psychic control.

The mage can reflexively use this [[Attainments|Attainment]] under the following circumstances:
- She is being forcibly bound into a magical oath, contract, or geas.
- A supernatural compulsion to do something she does not wish to do is directed at her.
- A supernatural effect is changing her destiny.

The mage is immediately aware when one of the above circumstances applies, and may protect herself by spending a point of Mana.

The character enters a [[Clash of Wills]] with the intruding power, using her [[Gnosis]] + [[Fate]].
