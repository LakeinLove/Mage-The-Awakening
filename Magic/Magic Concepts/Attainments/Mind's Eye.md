_The mage can see Goetia, other Astral entities, and beings using supernatural powers to project out of their bodies in Twilight when using Active Mage Sight with Mind._

---

Her Peripheral Mage Sight reacts to even the passive presence of such entities.

The mage detects Goetia and Mental Twilight phenomena with her Periphery, and can automatically see Goetia and projecting beings in Twilight with her Mind Sight.

If a Goetia is using a power to hide, it provokes a Clash of Wills.\
With the expenditure of one point of Mana, the mage can interact with Goetia for a scene.\
She can speak with them, touch them, and even strike them. However, this renders her vulnerable to their attentions, as well.
