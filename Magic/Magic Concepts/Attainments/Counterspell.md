_By learning even the most basic principles of an [[Arcanum]], a mage understands how to counter a spell._

---

Counterspell is a [[Clash of Wills]], pitting the acting mage’s [[Gnosis]] + [[Arcanum]] against the countering mage’s [[Gnosis]] + [[Arcanum]].

A mage can attempt to counter any spell that uses the [[Arcanum]], even if it uses other Arcana as well, but always counters the highest [[Arcanum]] of a target spell. The comparative ratings of the two mages’ [[Arcanum|Arcana]] are irrelevant; an Initiate can, in theory, counter the spell of a Master.\
Countering the spell of a mage with a higher rating in the target [[Arcanum]], however, requires that the player spend a point of Mana.

Counterspell requires an instant action. If the mage is employing [[Active Mage Sight]], she can attempt to counter a spell of the appropriate [[Arcanum]] in combat, regardless of her position in the Initiative order, provided she has not used her action yet.

Knowledge of one [[Arcanum]] imparts the understanding of how to unravel it. To cast a spell, the mage forms an Imago; to counter a spell, the mage simply needs to disrupt one.

The Counterspell [[Attainments|Attainment]] is actually 10 different [[Attainments]], one for each [[Arcanum]]. By learning even the most basic principles of an [[Arcanum]], a mage understands how to counter a spell.\
By the time a spell takes effect and a mage feels it in [[Peripheral Mage Sight]], though, it’s too late to counter; to use this [[Attainments|Attainment]], the countering mage must see her rival casting in [[Active Mage Sight]].

### Example

A [[Moros]] mage is using Active Death Sight during a fight with some Seers of the Throne.\
She sees that one of them is about to cast a [[Death]] spell at one of her compatriots. Even if the Seer acts before her in the Initiative order, she can attempt to Counterspell.\
If the Seer had been readying a [[Forces]] spell, the [[Moros]] would have noticed it, but could not attempt to counter it with [[Death]] (she could, however, use [[Universal Counterspell]] if she had [[Prime]] 2).
