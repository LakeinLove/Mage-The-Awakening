_Wind, fire, extreme cold, and lightning â€” the forces of nature are largely under the command of the Adept of Forces, and she can ignore them with near impunity._

The player spends a point of Mana. The character is thereafter immune to the effects of Environmental Tilts and Extreme Environments, for the rest of the scene.

Note that this Attainment does not protect the mage from Forces spells aimed at her specifically.\
In such cases, the Imago of the spell includes damage to her, and thus she must make a more concerted effort to avoid it (perhaps by using the [[Counterspell]] Attainment).
