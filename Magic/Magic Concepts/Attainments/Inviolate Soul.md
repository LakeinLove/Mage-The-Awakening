_The soul of an Adept of [[Death]] is almost impossible to affect, let alone harm or dislodge._

The mage can reflexively repel deleterious magic that will or could harm her soul.

The mage can reflexively use this [[Attainments|Attainment]] under the following circumstances:

- Her soul is being tampered with or attacked.
- Something attempts to alter or influence her [[Nimbus]] or aura.
- Anything attempts to possess her.

The mage is immediately aware when one of the above circumstances applies, and may protect herself by spending a point of [[Mana]].\
The character enters a [[Clash of Wills]] with the intruding power, using her [[Gnosis]] + [[Death]].
