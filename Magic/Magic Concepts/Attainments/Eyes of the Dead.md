_The mage can see ghosts and souls in Twilight when using Active Mage Sight with [[Death]]. Her Peripheral Mage Sight reacts to even the passive presence of ghosts._

---

The mage detects ghosts and deathly Twilight phenomena with her Periphery, and can automatically see souls and ghosts in Twilight with her [[Death]] Sight. If a ghost is using a power to hide, it provokes a Clash of Wills.

With the expenditure of one point of Mana, the mage can interact with ghosts for a scene. She can speak with them, touch them, and even strike them. However, this renders her vulnerable to their attentions, as well.
