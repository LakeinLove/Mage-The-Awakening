_All mages can spend [[Mana]] to heal wounds, but an Apprentice of [[Life]] can use that [[Mana]] more efficiently, healing more or more serious wounds with the same amount of energy._

In addition, Scouring her Pattern for [[Mana]] becomes easier and less detrimental.

Instead of each bashing or lethal wound costing three points of [[Mana]], the mage can heal bashing damage at a rate of one wound per point of [[Mana]], and lethal damage at a rate of one wound per two points of [[Mana]].

In addition, if the mage Scours a Physical [[Attribute]], any derived traits based on that [[Attribute]] are not affected (for instance, the mage can Scour a dot of [[Strength]] without losing a point of [[Speed]]).
