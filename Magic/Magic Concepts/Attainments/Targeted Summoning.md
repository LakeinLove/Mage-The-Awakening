With three dots in an [[Arcanum]], a mage can add greater specificity when summoning a Supernal being.

All Supernal beings have a primary [[Arcanum]], defined by their home Realm and the type of being (manifest or recondite).\
They can have other [[Arcanum|Arcana]], however, and a mage using this [[Attainments|Attainment]] can narrow her summoning to Supernal beings with particular powers.

The mage spends one additional [[Mana]] during the summoning, and specifies a second [[Arcanum]] for the target Supernal being.\
The primary [[Arcanum]] must remain one of the mageâ€™s two Path Ruling [[Arcanum|Arcana]].
