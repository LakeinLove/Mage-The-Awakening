_The mage can see spirits in Twilight when using [[Active Mage Sight]] with Spirit._

---

Her [[Peripheral Mage Sight]] reacts to even the passive presence of such entities.

The mage detects spiritual Twilight phenomena with her Periphery, and can automatically see spirits and projecting beings in Twilight with her [[Spirit]] Sight.

If a spirit is using a power to hide, it provokes a [[Clash of Wills]].\
With the expenditure of one point of Mana, the mage can interact with spirits for a scene.

She can speak with them, touch them, and even strike them, however, this renders her vulnerable to their attentions, as well.
