_The mage understands the intricacies of Forces to such a degree that she can optimize their intentional application, perfectly directing her energy when striking an object with a mundane attack or spell that involves a physical projectile._

If the mage has a full turn to calculate her action, she can take the 9-Again quality on the roll

If she’s applying force to a stationary object, she can ignore two points of Durability, and a successful hit automatically causes two additional Structure damage.\
Against a stationary, armoured target, this strike destroys (and ignores) 1/1 armour if successful.

This [[Attainments|Attainment]] doesn’t work against anything moving faster than a casual walk.
