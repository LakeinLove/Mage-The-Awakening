_The concept of sympathy is a complex one, and the libraries of the Orders contain volumes on the subject, but briefly: Two subjects may become sympathetically linked when they share a strong emotional, physical, or mystical connection._ 

Sympathy is tied to both [[Shadow Name|Shadow Names]] and [[Sympathetic Name|Sympathetic Names]], as well as being a critical element to the [[Nimbus]] of a mage and a powerful tool at their disposal.

Space allows a mage to manipulate, destroy, and create from nothing the occult bonds of sympathy.

Naturally-occurring links are sometimes permanent, but just as often fade over time: a brief but passionate love affair’s link might fade within a few weeks of the breakup, while a murder weapon retains links to both killer and victim for years.

Sympathetic links manipulated with the Space Arcanum echo from the Supernal to the Fallen, wreaking subtle but long-standing changes in the subjects.\
Sever a man’s link to his husband and the relationship cools and grows distant.\
Create a bond between a woman and a gun, and she’ll find herself thinking about it, dreaming about it — and left to their own devices odds are good woman and gun will cross paths.

This isn’t precisely mind control, or even an expression of Fate magic: all Space can do is manipulate the connections, not control reactions or guarantee outcomes.\
Maybe the chilled couple seeks counselling and repairs their relationship.\
Maybe the woman tells herself she’s being crazy and deliberately ignores thoughts of firearms.

The point is that playing with people’s sympathetic links has a real, tangible effect on their lives. The Wise look askance on those mages who endeavour to cull their own sympathetic “vulnerabilities” with good reason.

Most spells dealing with sympathy use the connections themselves as the spells’ subjects, and are Withstood by the links’ relative strength — deeper bonds are more difficult to affect.

Mages with Space 2 or more can also use links to cast other spells on subjects not within sensory range, by routing their magic along the lines of sympathy using an Attainment.\
In these cases, the spell is Withstood by Space itself; weaker connections are more difficult to use.

When affecting links with magic, each connection is treated as a subject for purposes of spell factors.\
For example, a spell that dampens a sympathetic connection can dampen multiple connections by increasing the Scale factor
