_Acts of Hubris determine when a mage risks [[Wisdom]] degeneration._

---

While this list is not exhaustive, it’s also only a series of guidelines. Feel free to add, take away, or adjust as you see fit. Mages of greater [[Wisdom]] consider lesser acts to be Acts of Hubris. 

The greatest minds fall the easiest.\
[[Wisdom]] comes in three tiers: 
- Enlightened 
- Understanding
- Falling

A character within that tier suffers when committing acts within or beneath that tier. The tier of the Act of Hubris also determines the base dice pool to resist degeneration. Note that this is the tier of the act, not the mage. A mage at [[Wisdom]] 8 only gets one die to resist a Falling-level act.

## Levels of Wisdom

### Wisdom 8–10, High / Enlightened (5 dice) 

These highest levels of [[Wisdom]] force the mage to walk a careful line. Any minor Act of Hubris risks degeneration. At this level, any time the mage uses a spell to accomplish something she could do through mundane methods with little or no risk poses the chance for degeneration. When innocent bystanders are affected by your character’s spells or actions, she is at risk as well.

### Wisdom 4–7, Medium / Understanding (3 dice)

Most experienced and stable mages fall into this range of [[Wisdom]]. Sometimes, Acts of Hubris happen. But by and large, the mage acts with basic [[Wisdom]] most of the time. Allowing a [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] to witness obvious magic, thus risking greater [[Paradox]], can cause degeneration. Self-mutilating events such as soul stone creation risk degeneration. Not attempting to contain a severe [[Paradox]] risks degeneration as well. Forcing a sapient being (whether a [[Sleepers|Sleeper]], spirit, or anything else) to act counter to its interests, altering its nature long-term, or binding it to a task all risk degeneration, as does deliberate and premeditated murder and violence that leaves its victim with long-term injury.

### Wisdom 1–3, Low / Falling (1 die)

Hubris of this level concerns all mages. A mage at this precipice could be lost to his magic at any time. Only the darkest, most selfishly destructive acts risk degeneration at this point. Killing someone in a fit of rage, destroying an Awakened soul, allowing a Supernal being to be consumed by the Fallen World, or dealing with [[The Abyss]] can force the mage through her final loss of [[Wisdom]].

### Wisdom 0

A character with no [[Wisdom]] is forever lost. His hubris has overcome him, and he’s become one of “The Mad.” His magic leaks into the world, letting the Supernal out wherever he goes. He cannot control his magic; it controls him.
