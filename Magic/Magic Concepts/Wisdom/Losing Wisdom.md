_[[Wisdom]] decays through [[Act of Hubris|Acts of Hubris]], wherein a mage ignores consequence in pursuit of her goals. Every mage and every circumstance is different from a [[Wisdom]] standpoint. Two mages in nearly identical circumstances may cast the same spell or commit the same action, but to one, his [[Wisdom]] is safe while the other risks degeneration._

---

Different levels of [[Wisdom]] handle degeneration differently. As a mage’s [[Wisdom]] decreases, she becomes inured to loss, and only great [[Act of Hubris|Acts of Hubris]] will risk degeneration. On the other side of the spectrum, a mage with high [[Wisdom]] stands in a constant balancing act between [[Wisdom]] and hubris, and any minor misstep can send her [[Wisdom]] plummeting.

As a Storyteller, assess each action for potential hubris, and compare to the character’s [[Wisdom]]. If the character’s [[Wisdom]] is equal to or higher than the level you feel fits the action, the character risks degeneration.

Degeneration risks use a number of dice depending on the relative [[Wisdom]] level of the [[Act of Hubris]]. Consult the [[Act of Hubris|Acts of Hubris]] list for how many dice each level of [[Wisdom]] act use. Note that the dice pool depends on the action; it doesn’t depend on the mage’s [[Wisdom]]. A mage with three dots of [[Wisdom]] and a mage with nine dots of [[Wisdom]] both use a base pool of 1 die if they commit a [[Wisdom]] 1 [[Act of Hubris]].

Following [[Obsessions]] hurts a mage’s chance to maintain [[Wisdom]], as that driving power makes him ignore the implications of his actions. If the Storyteller feels the mage commits an [[Act of Hubris]] in pursuit of his [[Obsessions]], remove one die from the dice pool for degeneration.

A character’s [[Virtue]] can add a die to the pool, if the act embodied hubris, but in defence of that [[Virtue]]. The character may very well understand and see the consequences of her actions, but she stands by them because she truly, fundamentally believes her actions are righteous.

On the other hand, following a [[Vice]] as an [[Act of Hubris]] is similar to an [[Obsessions|Obsession]]; it removes a die from the pool as your character indulges in what she believes is a moral failing.

Roll the resulting dice pool. You may not spend [[Willpower]] on this roll.

### Roll Results

#### Dramatic Failure

Your character not only loses a dot of [[Wisdom]] from her complete disregard for the world around her, but she also gains a Persistent Condition pertaining to the hubris. Take Megalomaniacal or Rampant. The normal resolution gives a Beat. Your character may only resolve the Condition permanently by gaining a dot of [[Wisdom]].

#### Failure

Your character loses a dot of [[Wisdom]], as she fails to see the consequences and ripples from her actions. Take the Megalomaniacal or Rampant Condition.

#### Success

Your character is able to examine and understand the ramifications of her actions. She does not lose [[Wisdom]].

#### Exceptional Excess

Your character’s [[Wisdom]] is reinforced by examining the risk and consequences of her actions. Take an additional [[Arcane Beats|Arcane Beat]] from the epiphany.

---

Any time your character risks [[Wisdom]] degeneration, she gains an [[Arcane Beats|Arcane Beat]]. Exploring the depths of hubris can be enlightening. 

Additionally, some spells that attack the soul, or powers of other supernatural creatures in the Fallen World, can temporarily reduce [[Wisdom]] until their effects wear off.
