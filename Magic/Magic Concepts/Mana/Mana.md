_Mana is the palpable, measurable bleed of the Supernal into the material. It’s a [[Prime]] energy, a quintessential force that comes from the energy trapped when the Abyss came into existence, or sometimes comes into existence from the glory and greatness of the world._

In a Hallow, it can suffuse a physical object, forming tass.\
Mages can keep a certain amount of Mana in their [[Patterns]] depending on their [[Gnosis]] dots. Alternatively, tass can be physically held and carried around in whatever quantities the mage can stockpile.

A Mage’s [[Gnosis]] determines her [[Patterns|Pattern]]’s capacity for Mana storage, but it also determines how quickly she can spend it. Consult the [[Gnosis]] chart for these numbers.

_Mana can be spent as a reflexive action to:_
- Improvise a spell not based on your character’s Ruling Arcana. Improvising a spell outside your character’s Ruling Arcana requires a point of Mana.
- Reduce [[Paradox]] risk on a spell by one die per point of Mana spent.
- Attainments often cost Mana to activate, as noted in their rules.
- Some powerful spells that push the boundaries of natural physics or violate [[Lie|the Lie]] require Mana.

## Mana Costs

Some quick reminders of spellcasting effects that cost Mana:

- Each improvised spell (not Praxes or Rotes) outside Ruling Arcana costs a point of Mana.
- Many Attainments require Mana or are more efficient with its use.
- Spells that directly call upon the perfection of the Supernal Realms require a point of Mana.

This includes the following effects:
- Indefinite Duration
- Inflicting aggravated damage
- Healing aggravated damage
- Granting the Rote Action Quality
- Granting automatic success or failure
- Boosting Traits beyond the subject’s maximum rating or altering that rating

## Pattern Restoration

As an instant action, a mage can bolster her [[Patterns|Pattern]] and heal mentally or physically. Three Mana points can heal a level of bashing or lethal damage. Alternatively, the mage can remove a Mental Condition (this does not offer a Beat) or a Physical Tilt.

Mages attempting a feat that requires Mana above their [[Gnosis]]-derived spending limits may take as many Turns as needed before the action to spend the required Mana. If they are interrupted or change their minds part-way through, Mana spent is still lost.
