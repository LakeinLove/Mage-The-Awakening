_A Mystery is that which begs to be explored and understood. They are hunted and solved by Mages in order to extend the Mage's understanding of the [[Supernal]]_

---

Any magical puzzle, any lingering spell, any otherworldly enigma is potentially a Mystery. All Mysteries break down into 3 parts:

- [[Opacity]]
- [[Mystery#Surface Information]]
- [[Mystery#Deep Information]]

---

There is one hard rule of Magic:
- It cannot be fully learned without being experienced.

Magic leaves the practitioner transformed, and the journey of encountering the mysterious and exploring it is as important to a mage’s development as whatever rush she feels at the end of the trail when something’s been pinned down and understood.

And the world is teeming with Mysteries.

The ubiquity of [[High Speech]] in the [[The Fallen World|Fallen World]] is only one of the many phenomena mages describe as the Mysteries.\
In essence, the Mysteries are that which begs to be explored and understood. The journey along the paths or symbols that accompany [[Awakening]] is only the beginning of the mage’s exploration of the Mysteries.\
He cannot increase his understanding of the [[Supernal]] power he wields except by seeking them out and experiencing them. Books and mentors can put a mage on the scent of a Mystery, but they cannot bestow the spiritual epiphany a direct encounter offers.

Old, European magical societies started calling what a mage experiences when chasing magic a “Mystery Play” — a story with a symbolic moral at the end. Every Mystery solved is a miniature reminder of the [[Awakening]], when the mage first saw through [[Lie|the Lie]].

Chasing a Mystery is intoxicating to a mage, and the journey itself is in many ways the destination. Even those Mysteries that cannot be easily solved can help a mage grow stronger in her [[Path]], applying her experiences to magic.

The [[Tapestry]] is vast and filled with Mysteries great and small. Although many have direct, obvious connections to the [[Supernal]], most do not.\
Nothing external forces a mage to pursue the Mysteries, but those who do not have a natural curiosity and a willingness to go to great lengths to satisfy it simply do not [[Awakening|Awaken]]. 

Mages see the world more deeply than [[Sleepers]] do, and when they notice something abnormal or out of place they feel an unmistakable impulse to examine it more closely.

## Surface Information

Surface information is the basic, concrete truth of a Mystery. This information is available upon a successful [[Revelation]], whether or not the mage has lowered the Mystery’s [[Opacity]] rating with [[Scrutiny]]. 

---

_In general, surface information should include the following:_
- Whether the Mystery is the result of Awakened magic.
- If so, what [[Arcanum|Arcana]] were involved and the [[Signature Nimbus]] of the caster (unless it was cast using a Rote).
- Roughly how old the Mystery is (hours, days, months, years, centuries).
- Optionally, what [[The 13 Practices|Practice]] created the Mystery (if a non-Supernal Mystery, then what [[The 13 Practices|Practice]] the Mystery most closely resembles).

## Deep Information

Deep information is the truth of a Mystery, the intent, the Supernal resonance. This information only presents itself if the mage unravels the Mystery’s [[Opacity]] and then succeeds in a [[Revelation]]. The Storyteller can arrange deep information in a number of ways, depending on the Mystery in question and the needs of the story.

One possibility is for all of the deep information to be available only after all of the [[Opacity]] is stripped away. This means that the character cannot learn anything other than surface information without reducing [[Opacity]] to 0, at which point the truth becomes clear. This is appropriate for low-[[Opacity]] Mysteries that do not have much in the way of deep information (lingering spells that the caster made no effort to hide) or, conversely, Mysteries that require full context and understanding to truly process. This method requires that the mage perform a successful [[Revelation]] after undoing the Mystery’s [[Opacity]] in order to gain the deep information.

Another method is to parcel out information each time the mage lowers the Mystery’s [[Opacity]]. This means that even if the mage doesn’t have the time or ability to fully understand a Mystery, she can learn something about it, perhaps enough to move the story forward and give her a new avenue of approach. With this method, the mage gains information as [[Scrutiny]] progresses, without having to perform a [[Revelation]].

A third method combines the previous two, granting minimal information as the mage unravels [[Opacity]], but still requiring a [[Revelation]] for the remainder of the deep information when the [[Scrutiny]] is complete.

In any case, the Storyteller controls how to parcel out deep information for Mysteries, and is under no restriction to be consistent. Mysteries do not follow patterns or rubrics; they are, by definition, unique and enigmatic. The Storyteller should make the decision for how to parcel out information for a given Mystery when she designs it, if for no other reason than to make her life easier when the characters actually come in contact with it

_Deep Information may include the following:_
- If [[Awakened]] magic cast using a [[Rote]], or the effects of an [[Attainment]], the [[Signature Nimbus]] of the mage involved.
- For [[Awakened]] spells, the [[Spell Factors]] involved (including the remaining duration), whether the spell caused a [[Paradox]] (and if so whether that [[Paradox]] was released or contained), and whether the spell has been relinquished.
- Identification of a phenomenon as being linked to one the mage has Scrutinized before.
- If not [[Awakened]] magic, the power level of the creator relative to the mage’s [[Gnosis]] (if applicable).
- Whether the Mystery is related to the Supernal Realms or [[The Abyss|Abyss]].
- How the [[Arcanum]] used relates to the Mystery — for example, using [[Death]] Sight to scrutinize a vampire’s ghoul will reveal Deep Information relating to the undead blood in the subject’s system, and any powers the ghoul has gained from it. Using [[Fate]] Sight to assess a changeling’s powers will reveal that they are formed by mystical bargains.
