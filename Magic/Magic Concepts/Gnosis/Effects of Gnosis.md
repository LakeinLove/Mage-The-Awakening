_[[Gnosis]] is a primary element for gameplay in mage, revolving around spellcasting and all general magical effects_

---

_[[Gnosis]] affects Numerous factors in gameplay:_
- When ritual casting, [[Gnosis]] determines the amount of time a spell takes to cast. At the lowest levels of [[Gnosis]], any ritual casting will take hours at least, and force a mage to stay awake for greater spells. As [[Gnosis]] increases, ritual casting becomes quicker.
- [[Gnosis]] builds the foundation for spellcasting dice pools. Whereas a mundane action uses an [[Attribute]] and a [[Skill]], the “[[Attribute]]” in spellcasting is [[Gnosis]], while [[Arcanum]] is the “[[Skill]].”
- [[Gnosis]] determines your character’s maximum traits. Normally, a character is limited to five dots in [[Skill|Skills]] and Attributes. However, at [[Gnosis]] 6+, your character can achieve higher [[Attribute]] and [[Skill]] ratings.
- Upon [[Awakening]], a mage can only use two Yantras in a given spellcasting. At higher [[Gnosis]] levels, she becomes able to integrate more Yantras into her casting.
- [[Gnosis]] determines how many spells your character can have active before she needs to Reach. This is direct, one-for-one. Every dot equals a spell.
- [[Gnosis]] determines the number of [[Obsessions]] your character may have at once.
- Legacy Attainments are limited by [[Gnosis]]. As the character’s [[Gnosis]] increases, the number of potential Attainments does as well; the [[Arcanum]] limits of the specific Attainments also increase.
- [[Gnosis]] determines the number of [[Paradox]] dice that are incurred for each Reach above [[Arcanum]] limits.
- [[Gnosis]] allows your character to combine multiple spells into a single casting, to get around limitations on numbers of active spells. At [[Gnosis]] 3, a mage can combine two spells into one casting. At [[Gnosis]] 6, she can combine three. And at [[Gnosis]] 9, she can combine four spells
- [[Gnosis]] limits the upper limit of a mage’s [[Arcanum|Arcana]]. A mage’s highest [[Arcanum]] can be three dots at [[Gnosis]] 1, four dots at [[Gnosis]] 3, and five dots at [[Gnosis]] 5. That mage’s other [[Arcanum|Arcana]] are limited to a maximum of two dots at [[Gnosis]] 1, three dots at [[Gnosis]] 2, four dots at [[Gnosis]] 4, and five dots at [[Gnosis]] 6.
- [[Gnosis]] acts as a mage’s “power trait” and adds to Supernatural Tolerance rolls. In contested rolls to resist some supernatural powers, [[Gnosis]] adds to the dice pool.
- [[Gnosis]] determines how much [[Mana]] a mage can contain within her [[Patterns|Pattern]], and how quickly she can process it. The chart notes a maximum [[Mana]], and how much she can spend in a turn at her level of [[Gnosis]].
- A mage’s [[Nimbus]] is partially determined by her [[Gnosis]].
- Every dot of [[Gnosis]] comes with a free Praxis.
