_Gnosis is the power and understanding that drives [[Awakened]] magic. It is not magic, but it is the necessary, essential element to build and to foster magic._

Gnosis is largely a subconscious awareness. It’s your character’s ability to take a mental leap beyond what others can; she can connect dots others cannot even see.\
She understands the universe intuitively, and can see the threads she must pull to enact meaningful change. For her, the question is never how to make change, but instead whether she’s able and willing to do what is necessary.

Have you ever been the expert in a room full of opinionated but uninformed people?\
Think about the feeling you get when they speak intellectual falsehoods, and others agree.\
Think about the feeling you get when your voice is shouted down by the raw numbers of other voices.\
Then, think about the feeling you get when your voice begins to click and resonate with the audience, and you feel you can make a change, to inform, to enlighten. 

Multiply those feelings one-hundredfold and you have an idea of what Gnosis is.

## Gnosis by Path

Gnosis is different for everyone. Your character’s [[Path]] flavours her Gnosis, as well as every facet of her identity.

### Acanthus

They see strands of fate in everything. There’s no such thing as a true coincidence; the universe follows fractal patterns that are just too hard for the average mind to understand. The [[Acanthus]] see a web, a weave, where given enough time and space, threads must all somehow connect. 

At greater Gnosis, they begin to intuitively know just where and when they’ll connect, and thus how to manipulate the variables to bring about their desired outcomes. Classic mythology teaches us that we can’t change fate. High-Gnosis [[Acanthus]] can. For many, this understanding of what’s to come, and what could come, breeds a strong sense of responsibility.

### Mastigos

They see the darkness. They see the stains and sins within every soul, lingering inside every mind. They understand motivations, and they can sense the selfishness all around them. Almost nobody is clean and pure. This typically results in a certain amount of cynicism in potent [[Mastigos]]. After all, what’s the sense in saving the world, when it’s full of such terrible people?

### Moros

They see the way things will end. They see death. They see destruction. They see entropy. Even the most beautiful statue is only beautiful in the moment. Eventually, it’ll lose its colour and shape to the weather around it, and [[Moros]] know this intimately. For this reason, the strongest of the [[Moros]] often ignore minor consequences, since they see that everything ends up dust anyway.

### Obrimos

They see the depths, the potential in all things. When they look at a person, a place, or thing, they sense what it could be. For many [[Obrimos]], this offers a sharp sense of inspiration and motivation; they want to see the world improve. For others, it can breed deep pessimism. After all, they see the potential everyone wastes and refuses to embrace. Even the greatest squander some possibility within them.

### Thyrsus

They see life in everything. To the [[Thyrsus]]’s wisdom, life will out. To that mind, a nuclear wasteland is but a temporary setback. This breeds a very liberal viewpoint; it’s often not worth intervening in all but the most existential of crises, as in the end, everything will be alright.\
This also highlights the contrary, though. That which is unnatural and threatens that long-term balance is a clear and present danger above anything as mundane as an immediate threat to human life.
