_In game terms, [[Gnosis]] can be raised by expending five Experiences in any combination of standard [[Experience|Experiences]] or [[Arcane Experience|Arcane Experiences]]._

In the narrative, [[Gnosis]] requires knowledge and understanding. It requires moments of epiphany, study, and experience. [[Gnosis]] increases when your character has advanced philosophically, mystically, or academically in such a significant way that she’ll never see the world the same.

While they’re not as influential and life-changing as the [[Awakening]] itself, these are moments the character will likely never forget, milestones in her advancement that show clear evolution of thinking, purpose, or identity. Whenever your character increases in [[Gnosis]], consider changing or refining her [[Virtue]] or [[Vice]]. Definitely look to [[Aspirations]] and [[Obsessions]] for potential changes. The character doesn’t necessarily become a completely different person, but she’ll come out changed.
