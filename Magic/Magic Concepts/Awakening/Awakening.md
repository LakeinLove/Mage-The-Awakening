_Awakening is when a [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] becomes a Mage_

The Awakening is the moment a [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] has an opportunity to wake from the [[Lie]]: 
It is the culmination of stirrings they have had in Sleep, and their chance to seize sight from sightlessness.

The [[Supernal Realms]] call to [[Sleepers]] in a soft insistent voice that usually remains unheeded.\
Their slumber is often too deep, and the whispers begging them to Awaken do not penetrate. 

Occasionally, though, a [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] will drift into semi-consciousness and hear a voice from afar; a call that will be incorporated into the [[Lie]] they always thought was reality.

Sometimes these manifest in literal, vivid dreams, haunting the [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] with symbols of the [[Supernal Realms]]; other times the symbols appear in the waking world as ordinary things suddenly heavy with meaning.

However the stirrings manifest, it continues to drop unmistakable hints that some absolute truth the [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] has always taken for granted is, in fact, a lie. It is a part of THE [[Lie]], and the semi-conscious [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] begins to see them as such.

This restless Sleep frequently persists for weeks, some mages have even reported spending decades Sleeping fitfully, their lives defined by recurring symbols and themes of the [[Supernal Realms]] to which they eventually Awakened. This stirring is the prelude for what is to come, the pilgrimages that manifest as Waking World Dreams or Supernal Journeys.

## Waking World Dreams
Once a [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] has begun to stir, it becomes possible for her to descend into a waking world dream. The symbols of the Supernal World around her become more pronounced until they appear more real to her than the ordinary world. 

If she turns away from this opportunity, her soul drifts back into Sleep. If she accepts it, she no longer perceives the real world at all. Everything she experiences during the waking world dream manifests as a journey through the Supernal World. 

In her mind, she overcomes obstacles to the object of her quest. In the mundane world, her body interacts with strangers as though they were people in her waking world dream. Everything that happens to her in the mundane world echoes in the waking dream, and everything she does in the waking world dream affects the events of the real world. In rare cases this leads to impossible events in the real world. 

[[Quiescence]] quickly erases these incidents from the memories of any [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] witnesses. [[Sleepers]] cannot see the world as experienced by the seeker. Even other mages need to be of the same [[Path]] and be using their [[Mage Sight]] to look into the waking world dream. The Wise are familiar with the symptoms of such Awakenings, however, and most know well enough to stay out of the way — if a mage of the same [[Path]] attempts to intervene, he will often find himself cast in a role in the Awakening’s narrative. 

Disturbing the seeker during the dream carries the risk of preventing the Awakening, so only the [[Guardians of the Veil|Guardians]] and [[Seers of the Throne|Seers]] contemplate it with any frequency, and only then when absolutely necessary. Mages of all Orders will often tail the seeker in hopes of recruiting her if she successfully Awakens.

## Supernal Journeys
A small minority of Awakenings take place entirely within the soul of the seeker — sometimes the [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] is asleep or meditating when she hears the Watchtower’s call, but in other cases the moment of inspiration that triggers the Awakening is so strong that it catapults the seeker right out of her body. 

In a Supernal journey Awakening, the seeker experiences the Supernal Realm itself, removed from the shape of the world. She travels dreamscapes formed of her aspirational [[Path]]’s symbols, and interacts with its native entities divested of their masks. 

To onlookers, the seeker appears comatose or asleep for the duration of her journey, which can take any amount of time divorced from the subjective journey experienced. Some rare mages Awaken after what feels like months to find they haven’t even had time to fall to the floor. Other equally rare Awakenings take years of Fallen time, the new mage emerging from a coma.
