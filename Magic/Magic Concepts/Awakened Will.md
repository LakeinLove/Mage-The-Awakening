_The non-stat component of the [[Attribute]] [[Willpower]], the Mage's Will is their ability to impose their desires and goals upon the world itself. The Mage's Will confronts reality and it is reality that has no choice but to obey._

To cast a spell, she imagines the effect she desires, focuses her mind on the symbols of her [[Path]] that will create that effect (the Imago), and through the medium of her [[Gnosis]] makes the world obey.

Magic is an extraordinarily useful tool for the observation and analysis of the [[Mystery|Mysteries]]. Virtually all phenomena in the Fallen World can be observed and described by one or more [[Arcanum|Arcana]]. 

Mages largely agree that the rare exceptions are subjects that hail from Realms that are completely alien to human thought — including [[The Abyss]]. The Wise likewise recognize that not all [[Mystery|Mysteries]] are the result of Awakened magic — no more than the motion of the sea is caused by the existence of thermometers or barometers.
