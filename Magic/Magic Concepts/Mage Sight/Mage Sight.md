_A Mages eyes, after [[Awakening]], are never able to be closed._

Once [[Awakened]], a mage can’t go back to Sleep. The [[Lie]] is exposed, and magic filters and colours everything she sees, to a greater or lesser extent. A mage can intensify her perceptions of magic and glean a great deal of information about the world around her, but doing so has risks. 

Mage Sight has three levels: 
- [[Peripheral Mage Sight|Peripheral]] 
- [[Active Mage Sight|Active]] 
- [[Focused Mage Sight|Focused]]

Although a mage regains awareness of the world when his [[Awakening]] ends, he never again sees the world without the Supernal symbols underlying it. This [[Peripheral Mage Sight]] cannot be turned off, but a mage soon grows used to the Supernal symbols that outline phenomena closest to his [[Path]].\
If the mage chooses to concentrate on the symbols — an exercise known as [[Active Mage Sight]] — he perceives all the attributes related to those [[Arcanum|Arcana]] of which he has at least a rudimentary understanding. 

Finally, the mage can direct all his attention toward a single subject, blotting out all material distractions to closely examine the Supernal symbols that surround it. Such [[Focused Mage Sight]] can reveal the subject’s deepest [[Mystery|Mysteries]], but it can attract unwanted attention from the Supernal World.

Regardless of her [[Path]], a walk down a crowded sidewalk is never the same for a mage:

### Acanthus Mage Sight

To an [[Acanthus]], the world is replete with “trails,” odd time effects, and signifiers of fate acting on the world. [[Acanthus|Witches]] using [[Active Mage Sight]] often experience time dilation or contraction. Under [[Focused Mage Sight]], many [[Acanthus]] see the thorns — visual metaphors for the branching timelines running behind and ahead of everything, which might appear as shining cracks in surfaces, quicksilver vines, or shimmering lines in the air.

### Mastigos Mage Sight

To a [[Mastigos]], the world shows how all thinking minds turn back on themselves, and how illusionary separation and distance is. [[Mastigos|Warlocks]] experience warping distance, mirages, and feelings of being lost, watched, or chased. Thinking beings are surrounded by indistinct auras, wrapped in their own thoughts and emotions. Under [[Focused Mage Sight]], many [[Mastigos]] sense chains, bars, uniforms, or other representations of imposed boundaries.

### Moros Mage Sight

To a [[Moros]], the world is a quiet, settled place — sounds dampen to the point of whispers, and movement seems to slow. [[Moros|Alchemists]] often see after-images of destroyed items or corpses, or look on the world through a lens of entropy and decay. Under [[Focused Mage Sight]], [[Moros]] looking at places and people symbolizing distraction from the universe or holding on to things beyond their time (everything from a vampire’s Touchstone or a ghost’s Anchor to a fellow mage’s magical tool or a workaholic businessman’s office) see them set aside, discarded, or broken. [[Moros]] call these impressions shells or, when they’re locations, crypts.

### Obrimos Mage Sight

To the [[Obrimos]], the world is bursting with power. [[Obrimos|Theurgists]] see the interactions of [[Forces]] and [[Prime]] within everything, with the sense that the material world is straining at the seams, barely able to hold the power within itself. Under [[Focused Mage Sight]], [[Obrimos]] see the mandalas — complex, twisting patterns, visual interpretations of all forms of power and authority. [[Obrimos|Theurgists]] see the leader of a gang decorated in golden jewellery, hear the sun making its passage through the sky, and perceive halos around the holy.

### Thyrsus Mage Sight

[[Thyrsus]] experience the world as ecstasy, the feeling of transcending the self to connect to the world around you. The world under a [[Thyrsus]]’ Mage Sight is alive — some [[Thyrsus|Shamans]] experience a pulse, a rhythm connecting every creature, or see magic lapping in and out of Hallows like breath. Under [[Focused Mage Sight]], every living being is clearly part of the superorganism, playing its part like an individual cell in a body.

## Mage Sight Examples

Regardless of the [[Arcanum|Arcana]] a mage has studied, her Mage Sight is always coloured primarily by her [[Path]]. An [[Acanthus]] who adds [[Matter]] to her [[Active Mage Sight]] does not see inanimate objects the same way that a [[Moros]] does.

For example, when a [[Moros]] examines a knife he sees its physical composition, senses its rate of decay, recognizes how often it has been sharpened, and knows what must be done to reinforce its structure or shatter it. He recognizes a poorly made knife because he can see its physical flaws.

Meanwhile, a [[Mastigos]] perceives the knife in terms of its connections. Is it a mass-produced tool spat out by a machine in a miserable sweatshop in Southeast Asia, or was it forged with care by a hobbyist blacksmith new to the craft?\
Tracing back the connections of [[Sympathy]], the [[Mastigos]] knows the knife was made with inferior steel because someone involved in the blade’s production knowingly gave the factory poor-quality raw materials, or because the factory owner chose to cut corners during production.

The same is true of the other [[Path|Paths]]. The [[Obrimos]] sees the same knife in terms of all the energy that was put into it, and knows a faulty blade because it diverges too much from its platonic ideal. An [[Acanthus]] sees a thousand paths the knife may take and notes that it is fated to break at a critical moment. The [[Thyrsus]] notes the knife’s especially weak and sickly spirit and knows it reflects the poor quality of the blade.
