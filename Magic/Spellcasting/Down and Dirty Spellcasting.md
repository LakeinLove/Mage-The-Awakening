_Sometimes characters desire to cast spells or create effects that should be easy and require little risk or effort from the mage._

---

Often these spells are effects that the mage creates on a regular basis, and the risk of failure is small and has little to no impact on the drama of the story. Determining [[Spell Factors|spell factor]] penalties and [[Yantra]] bonuses for these kinds of spells is cumbersome.

In these cases, just have players roll [[Gnosis]] + [[Arcanum]].

Success on the roll equals a successful casting.\
If the player wanted to affect multiple subjects, or create a large effect with the spellcasting, then the number of success may determine the number of subjects or the size of an area affected by the spell effect.\
For example, if a mage wanted to revive all the dead roses in a garden, she could roll [[Gnosis]] + [[Life]] and each success would equal a 5 meter radius of revived roses.
