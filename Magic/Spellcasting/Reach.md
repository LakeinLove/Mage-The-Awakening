_The mage can utilize different techniques to get more out of her base spell after she determines the spell effects and the level of each [[Arcanum]] involved._

Most changes affect the dice pool as either bonus or penalty dice, but other, more profound effects require the mage to risk incurring a [[Paradox]] by Reaching.

Mages can Reach to move from a Standard to an Advanced spell factor chart, or create specialized effects in certain spells such as increasing damage type on attack spells. Each time she Reaches, she adds dice to the [[Paradox]] dice pool based on her Gnosis.

A character receives a free Reach — which does not add [[Paradox]] dice — per dot of her highest-rated [[Arcanum]] that meets or exceeds the spell’s requirement.\
For example a mage with four dots of the [[Mind]] [[Arcanum]] gains two free Reaches when casting a spell that requires [[Mind]] 3.

## Common Reach Effects

Most spells list Reach effects, and several Attainments that modify spellcasting require Reach to use. In addition to these, one Reach may:
- Move the spell from Ritual to Instant Casting Time
- Change the primary spell factor
- Move the spell from Standard to Advanced Potency
- Move the spell from Standard to Advanced Duration
- If at Advanced Duration, allow the spell to reach indefinite Duration (cost: 1 Mana)
- Move the spell from touch/self to sensory range
- If at sensory range, allow the mage to cast on a subject she is viewing remotely
- Move the spell from Standard to Advanced Scale
- Cast a spell when the mage has no spell control slots remaining (costs an extra Reach per spell already over)
