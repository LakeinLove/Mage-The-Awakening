_Unless specified otherwise, spell effects do not stack._

---

When multiple spells affect the same aspect of a character the effects of the spells do not stack, and instead the spell with the highest Potency takes effect.

For example, a character benefitting from a spell that grants her +1 Strength casts a spell that grants her +3 Strength. The original spell with +1 Strength is suppressed for the Duration of the new spell. Both spellâ€™s Durations continue to lapse, though only the highest Potency spell is active.

If the stronger spell lapses, the weaker spell reasserts itself until its remaining duration wears off.
