_Mages may work together towards a common goal for spellcasting._

This is handled like any other action where characters combine their efforts ([[Teamwork]]).

The mages involved in the spellcasting must all have at least one dot in the [[Arcanum]] required to cast the spell, while the leader must have the required [[Arcanum]] rating to cast it himself.\
If the leader knows the spell as a Praxis or Rote, the spell gains the benefits of those methods.\
Any secondary caster who meets the [[Arcanum]] requirements rolls her own casting and adds her successes as bonus dice to the leader.

If a secondary caster does not meet the [[Arcanum]] requirements, she rolls Gnosis (no [[Arcanum]]) with a â€“3 penalty, and provides any successes as bonus dice to the leader.\
Each participant must roll for [[Paradox]] separately; if any one of the casters releases a [[Paradox]] instead of containing it, it affects the entire spell.

Mages without the [[Arcanum]] used at all, Sleepwalkers, and Proximi may also assist in the casting, but do not roll. Instead, the casters may use their participation in the ritual as an environment Yantra.
