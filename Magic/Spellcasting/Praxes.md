_Through dedicated practice or repetitive use of certain spells, a mage may develop a Praxis._

Praxes are spell Imagos the mage has gained special insight into, learning the symbols of the spell by heart. She is more adept at casting these spells, and they shape her growing [[Gnosis]]. 

When casting a Praxis spell, the mage gains an exceptional success with three successes instead of five. Praxes do not require a point of [[Mana]]na]] to cast from Inferior or Common [[Arcanum|Arcana]], but any other [[Mana]] costs still apply

A mage gains one free Praxis for every dot of [[Gnosis]], and may purchase more for one [[Arcane Experience]] each. The character must be capable of casting the Praxis as an improvised spell.
