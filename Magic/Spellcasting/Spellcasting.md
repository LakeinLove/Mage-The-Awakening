_The Wise aren’t limited to the rote teachings handed to them to be used as blunt objects; within the bounds of their power, mages can conjure nearly any effect they can imagine._

This is the long-form version of the Spellcasting Guide, go there for a checklist.

---

To cast a spell from the premade list, one can simply select it from the list of example spells of each [[Arcanum|Arcana]].\
After choosing the effect, simply follow these steps and insert the options, however a mage is far beyond merely reusing tools given to them.

## Creative Thaumaturgy

This section provides step by step guidelines for creating your own spells, as well as casting the example spells.

### Step One: Declare Intent

First and foremost, decide exactly what you’re trying to accomplish with your spell. Don’t focus on how the magic will do what you want for now, just focus on what you want it to do.

Having a concrete idea for what the magic will do will facilitate everything after this.

### Step Two: Arcanum and Practice

Using the descriptions of the ten [[Arcanum|Arcana]] and the 13 [[The 13 Practices|Practices]] determine which [[Arcanum]] and which practice the spell falls under.\
Depending on the intent of the spell, this might be obvious, or there might be several ways you could go about accomplishing your intent. 

Don’t worry about whether the effect seems “too powerful” for its dot level or “unbalanced” compared to a similar effect under a different [[Arcanum]]; part of the fun of playing Mage is coming up with clever, unexpectedly-useful applications of magic.

### Step 3: Determine Effect and Cost

The effects of a spell can be incredibly broad, and it’s impossible to categorize every conceivable thing a mage might want to do with a spell, but this section will highlight some of the more common effects, how to adjudicate them, and what they should cost.\
Don’t think of this section as a “menu”; any individual spell should have a single, clear effect. If you start designing a spell that deals damage and grants bonus dice and imposes a Condition, you’re probably creating a [[Combined Spells|Combined Spell]] not a single spell.

All [[Mana]] costs are cumulative. A mage attempting a feat that requires [[Mana]] above her [[Gnosis]]-derived spending limit may take as many turns as needed before the action to spend the required [[Mana]].\
If she is interrupted or changes her mind part-way through, [[Mana]] spent is still lost.

#### Damage

A spell can deal damage directly, as in the case of a thunderbolt or an enervating touch, or indirectly, as in the case of rotting out a support beam to drop a house on someone.
- Direct damage spells can use many [[The 13 Practices|Practices]] depending on [[Arcanum]], but always inflict damage equal to Potency.
- ••• spells inflict bashing damage, while •••• spells inflict lethal damage.
- A lethal damage spell may be upgraded to aggravated damage for the cost of a point of [[Mana]] and one[[Reach]].

Spells that deal damage indirectly aren’t subject to these limits: A spell that causes a roaring bonfire to spread and consume the victim inflicts the standard damage for exposure to fire.

#### Healing

Healing spells are usually [[Practice of Perfecting|Perfecting]] (•••) or Patterning (••••) spells. A [[Practice of Ruling|Ruling]] (••) spell can boost a subject’s natural healing time.
- A [[Practice of Ruling|Ruling]] spell can halve the subject’s normal recovery time for its Duration, or quarter it with a[[Reach]].
- [[Practice of Perfecting|Perfecting]] spells heal bashing damage, repair inanimate objects, or heal lethal damage with a[[Reach]].
- Patterning spells heal lethal damage. If an inanimate object is completely destroyed rather than merely broken, it may require a Patterning spell to fix.
- A Patterning healing spell can repair aggravated damage instead of lethal at the cost of one point of [[Mana]] and a[[Reach]].

#### Conditions and Tilts

Conditions are an excellent source of inspiration for long-lasting spells.\
Because the effects of Conditions and [[Tilts]] are so broad, it’s difficult to assign hard-and-fast rules for [[The 13 Practices|Practices]] that inflict them. Use the [[The 13 Practices|Practice]] descriptions and the following list as a guideline:
- [[Practice of Compelling|Compelling]] (•) spells can’t create Conditions out of whole cloth, but can intensify phenomena that already exist to inflict Conditions. A [[Practice of Compelling|Compelling]] spell can make someone who’s already nervous [[Spooked]], for example, but can’t make someone who’s uninterested in the mage romantically Swooning.
- [[Practice of Ruling|Ruling]] (••) spells can create most non-Persistent, mundane Conditions. Supernatural Conditions, such as the [[Soulless]] Condition and its sequelae or Manifestation Conditions, generally require a [[Practice of Weaving|Weaving]] (•••) spell.
- Creating a Persistent Condition is almost always a Patterning (••••) or Unravelling (••••) effect.
- Spells most often inflict Conditions that harm, hinder, or inconvenience characters. Spells can mimic the effects of a helpful Condition, but using magic to gain a benefit and a [[Beats|Beat]] is double-dipping. Beneficial Conditions created by magic don’t grant [[Beats]] unless they’re the result of an exceptional success.
- [[Tilts]] are usually created by applying a[[Reach]] to an attack spell, but if you want to create one on its own, it’s usually a [[Practice of Fraying|Fraying]] (•••) or Patterning (••••) spell.

Conditions created with magic only last as long as the Duration factor of the spell. If the target resolves the Condition before the Duration expires, the spell ends early and the target gains a [[Beats|Beat]] as normal. (It’s the Storyteller’s call whether the [[Beats|Beat]] is normal or Arcane.)\
If the Duration runs out, the Condition goes away; but that doesn’t count as resolving the Condition.

Removing a condition with magic is always at least a [[Practice of Ruling|Ruling]] (••) spell, but otherwise follows the same guidelines as creating one.

#### Bonuses and Penalties

Spells that grant bonus dots to traits can belong to nearly any [[The 13 Practices|Practice]], depending on what the Trait represents.\
Obvious examples include [[Practice of Perfecting|Perfecting]] for directly increasing the Attributes and Skills of a target, but a [[Practice of Ruling|Ruling]] spell to make a corpse rise up and serve you can be modelled as a spell that grants you [[Retainer]] dots.
- Increasing a Merit is typically a [[Practice of Ruling|Ruling]] (••) spell. Attributes and Skills can be increased by a [[Practice of Perfecting|Perfecting]] (•••) spell. Gaining a Skill that has no dots is a Patterning (••••) spell.
- Spells that grant or increase equipment bonuses count as Trait bonuses. This also applies to spells that simply increase a dice pool.
- A spell can grant a total number of Trait dots equal to its Potency. Advantages, such as [[Gnosis]] or a vampire’s Blood Potency, cannot be granted by spells, nor can supernatural abilities like [[Arcanum|Arcana]] or Disciplines.
- Any spell that increases a Trait beyond the target’s natural maximum costs a point of [[Mana]]. Remember that high-[[Gnosis]] mages and other supernatural creatures may have Trait maximums higher than 5. The “Trait maximum” for an equipment bonus is always +5.
- Trait dots granted by magic last only as long as the spell’s Duration, and are not subject to the Sanctity of Merits rule.

#### Dice Effects

- A [[Practice of Ruling|Ruling]] (••) spell can grant the 9-Again rule to a dice pool of relevant actions, or 8-Again with one[[Reach]].
- A [[Practice of Perfecting|Perfecting]] (•••) spell can grant the rote action quality at the cost of one point of [[Mana]].
- The spell affects one roll per point of Potency. If the spell’s Duration expires before the Potency is used up, any excess Potency is lost.

#### Protection

Most commonly with the [[The 13 Practices|Practice]] of [[Practice of Shielding|Shielding]] (••), a spell may grant protection from forces under the [[Arcanum]]’s purview.\
These spells usually provide blanket immunity to natural or mundane phenomena, while protecting against a number of supernatural attacks equal to the spell’s Potency. Such attacks must win a [[Clash of Wills]] to affect the target.

#### Hiding

[[Practice of Veiling|Veiling]] (••) spells render the target undetectable to certain phenomena or types of beings. This stealth is fully effective against ordinary senses, and provokes a [[Clash of Wills]] against mystical detection attempts.

#### Narrative Effects

This is a catch-all category for spell effects that influence the fiction of the game but don’t interact directly with the mechanics. Things like walking through walls, shaping clay into a statue, or transmuting one substance into another fall under this category.
- Most narrative effects will care less for Potency than for Scale, Range, and other [[Spell Factors]]. However, if the effect could have varying degrees of success (consider trying to calm a hurricane: There’s a whole range of possibilities between “nothing happens” and “a dead calm”), the Storyteller should establish Potency requirements. The guidelines for determining the number of successes required on an [[Extended Action]] provide a good rule of thumb.
- Making a spell Lasting always costs +2[[Reach]], but you should think carefully before allowing it — only spells without any way to revert them should have the option.

### Step Four: Determine Withstand Trait

[[Withstanding Magic|Withstanding]] is to resist a spell.\
Spells that directly target a subject’s body, mind, or soul are usually Withstood by one of the subject’s Resistance Attributes.\
Spells that cross [[the Gauntlet]] are Withstood by the local [[The Gauntlet#Gauntlet Strength|Gauntlet Strength]].\
Other spells might be Withstood by more esoteric values.

Look at the intended subject of your spell. Is it something that could “fight back” against the magic, or is there something that seems like it would require the mage to put more effort than usual into the spell? If so, that’s the value that Withstands it.\
Living (or undead) subjects usually [[Withstanding Magic|Withstand]] spells with [[Stamina]] (for physical transformations or afflictions), [[Resolve]] (for attempted mind control or other mental effects), or [[Composure]] (for emotional manipulation or effects that target sanity, perception, or the soul).\
Ephemeral entities [[Withstanding Magic|Withstand]] spells with their Rank.

Supernatural beings like mages, vampires, or demons do not add their Supernatural Tolerance trait to [[Withstanding Magic|Withstand]] a spell.

Spells are only resisted or contested if some supernatural power would interfere with the mage’s ability to form an Imago, such as counter magic.

Spells that inflict direct damage with [[The 13 Practices|the Practices]] of [[Practice of Fraying|Fraying]] and Unravelling are never Withstood; the subject’s [[Stamina]] is already factored in by virtue of the subject’s [[Health]].

### Step Five: Primary Factor

Determine which Factor is the Primary Factor. This is either Potency or Duration, with the rule of thumb of “whichever Factor you immediately think of when you think of a more powerful version of the spell.” The Primary Factor of a given spell effect is always the same; you can’t make a creative thaumaturgy spell that’s identical to another spell except with a different Primary Factor.
