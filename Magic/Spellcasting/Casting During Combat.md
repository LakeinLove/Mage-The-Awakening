_A mage casting a spell at standard range must successfully touch her subject._

See Touching an Opponent for more information on how to make contact for a spell cast at standard range.

Mages taking multiple turns to cast a spell (usually because they are utilizing [[Yantra|Yantras]] or spending more [[Mana]] than their [[Gnosis]] allows) still apply [[Defence]] against attacks but may not make combat actions unless another rule such as the [[Adamant Hand]] Merit allows it.
