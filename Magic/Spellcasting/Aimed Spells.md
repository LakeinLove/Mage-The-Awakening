_A mage can attempt to throw or fire her spell at her subject instead of touching him when casting at standard range._

---

Aimed spells appear as bolts of energy or projections coming from the casting mage, as opposed to spells cast at sensory range which materialize at the point of the subject.

The player rolls [[Gnosis]] + (highest of [[Athletics]] or [[Firearms]]) – subject’s [[Character Mechanics/Advantages/Defence|Defence]].

The subject may gain the benefits of cover, and range bands apply; an Aimed spell’s short range is [[Gnosis]] x 10, medium is [[Gnosis]] x 20, and long is [[Gnosis]] x 40 in meters.

A success means the spell hits her subject as intended, a failure means the spell effect misses its subject. Aimed spell rolls happen after spellcasting rolls and [[Paradox]] roll results have been determined, but are reflexive — they happen on the same turn as the spellcasting roll.
