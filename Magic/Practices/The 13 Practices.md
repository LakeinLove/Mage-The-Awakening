The 13 Practices are, for all intents and purposes, a classification system for every spell and magical effect of which a mage is capable.

There were once hundreds of bespoke categories for different spells and effects, but over time and as understanding of magic grew, the need for many categories diminished as forms blending into one another.\
Eventually only 13 remained, as general descriptors of magical forms as well as educationally useful distinctions: it helps that mages don't drive themselves insane attempting magical effects beyond their ability as they are learning.

These practices encompass almost everything anyone can do with magic, and though it is rumoured that there are mighty sorcerers capable of feats that do not clearly fall into any of the 13 practices, in the end it doesn't matter.\
This is a system for mortal understanding, it does not describe the true nature of magic itself.

From a mechanical perspective, these Practices help to guide you in your usage of magic and the creative magical effects you desire. It is useful to consider what Practice an effect might fall under, and which [[Arcanum|Arcana]] it might use. This dovetails nicely into the levels of ability and mastery of any given [[Arcanum|Arcana]], as only those of sufficient mastery can cast spells that use specific Practices.

In simple terms, the Practices are what you can do with any given [[Arcanum|Arcana]] at any given level of mastery. 

The Practices are divided along the 5 levels of mastery one is considered to be able to achieve.

### Initiate Level (One Dot Arcana):

- [[Practice of Compelling]]
  _Elementary manipulation of phenomena, enough to activate and/or impart direction_
- [[Practice of Knowing]]
  _Gain knowledge and understand of phenomena_

  _Gain sensory perception of phenomena_
  
### Apprentice Level (Two Dot Arcana):

- [[Practice of Ruling]]
   _Exert elementary command and control over phenomena_
- [[Practice of Shielding]]
  _Protect a target against attacks by providing points of Armour_
- [[Practice of Veiling]]
   _Conceal, camouflage or hide phenomena from [[Scrutiny]]_
   
### Disciple Level (Three Dot Arcana):

- [[Practice of Fraying]]
  _Injure a target_
- [[Practice of Perfecting]]
  _Fortify, bolster or improve phenomena_
- [[Practice of Weaving]]
  _Alter the capabilities or functions of phenomena_
  
### Adept Level (Four Dot Arcana):

- [[Practice of Patterning]]
  _Transform phenomena into a related phenomena or shapes, or replace capabilities or functions with different ones_

  _Significantly injure a target_
  
### Master Level (Five Dot Arcana):

These Practices are to help you make your spells work and define effects, they are NOT a prescriptive guide on what you can and cannot do within them, just a way to better understand them.
