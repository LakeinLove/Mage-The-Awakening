_Unmaking spells annihilate subjects under the [[Arcanum]]â€™s purview entirely. Life can be snuffed like a candle ([[Life]]), two locations can be forced into each other by destroying the distance between them ([[Space]]), even [[Hallows]] and [[Verges and Demesnes|Verges]] can be wiped from the Earth ([[Prime]])._

Unmaking spells are beyond inflicting direct damage with attacks; a successful Unmaking destroys the target altogether.
