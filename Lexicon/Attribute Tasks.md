_Some actions require no special expertise to perform._

---

Mostly, these come in the form of [[Wits]] + [[Composure]] rolls to notice something that doesn’t seem right, or using [[Strength]] + [[Stamina]] rolls to lift something. In these rolls, you add two different Attributes together to make your dice pool.

If an action doesn’t seem to involve any particular Skill, it can be handled by an [[Attribute]] Task.
