_Armour provides protection against attacks, including bullets and knives._

---

Though most mages rely on their [[Mage Armour]] [[Attainments]] to protect them instead of physical armour, police officers and other law enforcement agencies rely on it, and some highly combatant mages wear it as well.
- Ballistic armour applies to incoming firearms attacks. Each point of ballistic armour downgrades one point of damage from lethal to bashing.
- General armour applies to all attacks. Each point of general armour reduces the total damage taken by one point, starting with the most severe type of damage.

If armour has both ballistic and general ratings, apply the ballistic armour first.\
When applying armour to an attack dealing lethal damage, you always take at least one point of bashing damage from the shock of the blow.
