_A character who has taken drugs, willingly or not, must fight off the effects of the drug._

---

Resisting the effects requires a reflexive [[Stamina]] + [[Resolve]] roll. This roll is not contested but it is modified by the potency of the drug ingested.

Only one success is necessary for a character to regain her senses.\
In the case of some drugs, this roll must be made once per hour, once per scene â€” or even once per turn, in the case of strong hallucinogens or narcotics.
