_Mages trained in Forces know that a potentially deadly weapon lies almost everywhere in the modern world, kept caged by wires and cables._

Electrocution automatically causes bashing damage per turn of exposure. No attack roll is made.

If harm from electricity is more than just instantaneous — there’s a constant flow such as through power cables — a victim may not be able to escape.\
His muscles contract, which can prevent him from pulling away.\
Roll [[Strength]] as a [[Reflexive Action]] in each turn of contact. Failure means your character is still connected to the source and suffers its damage each turn until a successful roll is made.

| Source | Example                                     | Damage |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Minor  | Wall Socket                                 | 4      |
| Major  | Protective Fence                            | 6      |
| Severe | Junction Box                                | 8      |
| Fatal  | Lightning Bolt, Main Line Feed, Subway Rail | 10     |

Worn armour provides no protection against electrocution.
