_The firearms chart (below) lists the short, medium, and long ranges of some sample firearms._

---

Shooting a target at medium range imposes a –1 die penalty, while shooting a target at long range increases that to –2. Shooting at targets beyond long range reduces the attack dice pool to a chance die.

Thrown weapons have a short range of (Strength + Dexterity + Athletics – object’s Size), doubled for medium range, and doubled again for long range. Aerodynamic objects double each range — so an aerodynamic object’s long range is {(Strength + Dexterity + Athletics) * 8}.\
Characters can only throw objects with a Size less than their Strength.
