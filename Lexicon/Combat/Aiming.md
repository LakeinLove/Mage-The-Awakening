_Instead of firing, a character may spend a turn aiming at an opponent._

---

Each turn spent aiming adds a die to an attack roll, as long as the attack is the next action by the aiming character.\
Characters may aim for multiple turns before attacking, building up the bonus, but it may not exceed +3 dice.
