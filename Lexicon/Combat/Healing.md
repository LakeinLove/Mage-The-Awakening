_Characters need time to heal once they’ve been beaten to a pulp. Mages can speed healing times, and even close wounds with a single spell given enough mastery of the Arcana, but absent any supernatural effects recovery takes time._

A human character heals her rightmost Health box at the rate below. The healing time is enough for the wound to fully recover — lethal damage doesn’t “downgrade” into bashing.\
Normally, a character can heal without medical attention, though use of the Medicine Skill will doubtless help her recover. The only exception is if a human character has all her Health boxes full of lethal damage — she’s bleeding out.\
She can’t recover from that without urgent medical attention and emergency surgery.

Wounds recover at the following rates:
- **Bashing:** One point per 15 minutes.
- **Lethal:** One point per two days.
- **Aggravated:** One point per week.
