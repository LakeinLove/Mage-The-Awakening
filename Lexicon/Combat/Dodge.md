_At any point before your action, your character can choose to Dodge._

---

Dodging gives up her normal action.

When Dodging, double your character’s [[Defence]] but do not subtract it from attack rolls.\
Instead, roll [[Defence]] as a dice pool, and subtract each success from the attacker’s successes. If this reduces the attacker’s successes to 0, the attack does no damage. Apply successes from Dodging before adding any weapon bonus.

Against multiple opponents, reduce [[Defence]] by one for each opponent before doubling it to determine your dice pool. If your [[Defence]] is reduced to 0, you roll a chance die.\
A dramatic failure when Dodging leaves your character off-balance; reduce her [[Defence]] by –1 for her next turn.
