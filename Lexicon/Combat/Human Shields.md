_Sometimes, the only available cover is another person — be they a terrified member of the public or a life-long friend._

Characters who use human shields treat them as cover, with Durability equal to the victim’s [[Stamina]] + any armour.\
Unlike normal cover, the victim takes all of the damage from the attack.

Using a human shield is almost certainly a [[Breaking Point]] or [[Act of Hubris]].\
For a [[Sleepers|Sleeper]], this means a pretty severe modifier (–3 or more) if the victim dies; mages face an [[Act of Hubris]] at Enlightened or Understanding Wisdom.
