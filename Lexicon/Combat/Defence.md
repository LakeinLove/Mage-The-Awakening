_Subtract your character’s Defence from any unarmed, melee, or thrown attacks of which the character is aware._

---

Every time your character applies his Defence against an attack, reduce his Defence by –1 until the start of the next turn.\
Spending a point of Willpower increases her Defence by +2, but only against one attacker.

You can choose not to apply your character’s Defence against some attacks. If two unarmed gangbangers attack before a chainsaw-wielding lunatic, you might want to let the gangbangers get their blows in, and apply your full Defence against the maniac swinging a chainsaw at your head.

You cannot apply your character’s Defence against firearms attacks without supernatural assistance, whether it’s from a spell, an [[Attainments|Attainment]], or some other power that grants Defence against gunfire.

(I left the word "gangbangers" in because I find it hilariously dated, somehow this game was released in 2016)
