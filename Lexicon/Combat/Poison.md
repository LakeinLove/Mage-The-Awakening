_Outside of combat, a character who is the victim of a poison or toxin suffers lethal damage over a period of time equal to the poison’s Toxicity._

---

Some substances deal this damage only once.\
Others deal this damage once per turn or once per hour until purged — or until the poison has run its course.

To resist the damage, make a reflexive Stamina + Resolve – Toxicity roll. Each success reduces the damage taken by one point. This roll must be made every time the poison deals damage unless the character stops fighting and gives in.
