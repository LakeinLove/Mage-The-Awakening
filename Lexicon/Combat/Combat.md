_Mages aren’t necessarily violent by nature, but the Fallen World is a dangerous place; mages often come into conflict with rival mages, other supernatural beings, or Sleepers in the way of their Obsessions._

Combat is the catch-all term for what happens when tempers flare and one character attempts to do another harm.

Everybody wants something out of a fight. The very first thing you need to do — before worrying about who attacks first or anything like that — is to determine what each character wants to get out of the fight.\
Boil it down into a simple sentence that starts with the words “I want:” “I want to kill Johnny”, “I want the book that Frances is holding”, or “I want what’s in Larry’s wallet".

A character’s intent has to be something she could achieve through an act of violence in the current scene — even a gunman on the White House lawn couldn’t get away with “I want to be President of the United States".

By stating her character’s intent, a player is setting out how much her character is willing to hurt — even kill — someone else in order to get. If your intent has nothing to do with hurting people and you end up killing someone, you lose a point of Willpower.

### Surprise

Characters who don’t realize that they’re about to be on the receiving end of bloody violence have a chance to notice the ambush by rolling Wits + Composure, contested by the attacker’s Dexterity + Stealth.

Any character who fails the roll cannot take an action in the first turn of combat, and can’t apply Defence for that turn. Determine Initiative in the second turn as normal.
