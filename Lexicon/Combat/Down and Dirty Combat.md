_The Storyteller might decide that your character can get what she wants without focusing on the details of the fight._

---

Maybe she’s picking on people weaker than her. Maybe she’s internalized the mechanics of violence. Or maybe the fight’s not the important thing going on with regards to the character’s intent. If that’s the case, the Storyteller can opt to use a Down and Dirty Combat.\
This system resolves the entire fight in a single roll. Storyteller characters might deal some damage, but they’re never able to initiate a Down and Dirty Combat.

## Example

**Action:** Contested; resistance is reflexive\
**Dice Pool:** Combat pool ([[Dexterity]] + [[Firearms]], [[Strength]] + [[Brawl]], or [[Strength]] + [[Weaponry]]) versus either the opponent’s combat pool (as above) or an attempt to escape ([[Strength]] or [[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]). Ignore [[Defence]] on this roll.

### Roll Results

#### Dramatic Failure

The character’s opponent gets the upper hand. This usually includes the opposite of the character’s intent — if she wanted to disable the guards so she could escape, she is stunned instead.

#### Failure

The opponent wins the contest. If the opponent used a combat pool, deal damage equal to the difference in successes plus weapon modifier. Also, the opponent escapes unless he wants to press the combat.

#### Success

The character wins the contest. She deals damage equal to the difference in successes plus her weapon modifier and achieves her intent — if her intent includes killing her opponents, then she does so.

#### Exceptional Success

As a success, and the character also gains a point of [[Willpower]] from the rush of inflicting violence on an inferior opponent.
