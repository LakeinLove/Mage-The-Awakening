_Armour-piercing allows weapons or attacks to avoid or penetrate through armour_

---

Some weapons have an armour piercing quality, usually between 1 and 3. When attacking someone wearing armour, subtract the piercing quality from the target’s armour.\
Subtract from ballistic armour first, then general armour. Armour-piercing attacks in close combat subtract from general armour only.

When shooting at an object — or a person in cover — subtract the piercing quality from the object’s Durability.
