_Characters who overdose on drugs treat the drug like a poison, with a Toxicity somewhere between 3 and 7._

---

The overdose deals damage once per hour until the drug has run its course — if a character’s spent 8 hours drinking, then the poison takes another 8 hours to fade, with Toxicity between 3 (beer or wine) to 5 (rubbing alcohol).\
A character who injects stronger heroin than expected takes damage for (8 – Stamina) hours, with Toxicity 7.

Some sample severities for diseases, drugs, and poisons are listed below:

| Venom has a range                    | 3 (bad spider bite) to 8 (brown snake venom) |
| Drug/Alcohol abuse                   | 3 (moderate), 5 (heavy), 7 (overdose)        |
