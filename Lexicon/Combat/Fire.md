_Fire automatically inflicts lethal damage per turn of exposure (no attack roll is required)._

---

The damage inflicted depends on both the size and intensity of the flames.

| Size of Fire | Damage |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Torch        | 1      |
| Bonfire      | 2      |
| Inferno      | 3      |

| Heat of Fire                   | Modifier |
| ------------------------------ | -------- |
| Candle                         | -        |
| Torch                          | 1        |
| Bunsen Burner                  | 2        |
| Chemical Fire and Molten Metal | 3        |

So, a fire the size of a bonfire (2) and with the intensity of a torch (+1) inflicts three lethal damage per turn of contact.

In general, if exposure to fire persists for more than a turn, it ignites anything combustible. A burning character continues to take full damage, even if he escapes the original source of the flame. Depending on the accelerator involved, the size of a fire can be reduced by one level per turn by means such as a hose or extinguisher.\
The Storyteller may rule that a fire goes out immediately under some circumstances (local oxygen is removed with a controlled explosion or your character is completely immersed in water). Or, a fire could continue to burn despite efforts to put it out â€” such as with a grease fire when water is poured on it.

Most armour can block its general rating in fire damage automatically for a number of turns equal to that rating.
