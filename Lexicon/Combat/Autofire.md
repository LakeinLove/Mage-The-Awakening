_Automatic weapons can fire a short, medium, or long burst in place of a single shot._

---

- **Short Burst:** Three bullets fired at the same target. Add a +1 die bonus to the shooter’s dice pool.
- **Medium Burst:** Ten bullets, which can hit one to three targets standing close together. Add a +2 die bonus to the shooter’s dice pool. If firing at more than one target, subtract the total number of targets from the shooter’s pool, then make one attack roll per target.
- **Long Burst:** Twenty bullets at as many targets as the shooter wants. Increase the shooter’s dice pool by +3. If firing at more than one target, subtract the total number of targets from the shooter’s pool, then make one attack roll per target.
