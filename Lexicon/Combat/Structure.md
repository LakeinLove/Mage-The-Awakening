_An object’s Structure is equivalent to its Health and equals its [[Durability]] + [[Size]]._

---

Each point of damage removes a point of Structure.\
Once it’s taken more damage than it has [[Durability]], anyone using the object suffers a –1 die penalty.

When its Structure hits 0, the object is destroyed. Objects do not differentiate between bashing and lethal damage, and can be repaired with an appropriate Craft roll.
