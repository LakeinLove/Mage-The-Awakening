_Oblation is the act of meditation at a Hallow for the purposes of regaining Mana._

---

Oblation is the most common form of [[Gaining Mana]], where the mage restores their Mana via an hour of meditation at a [[Hallows|Hallow]].\
This is a very efficient process, but it is a common frustration for some mages, as access to a Hallow isn't always easy to come by.

A mage can perform Oblation without a Hallow if they have a [[Legacies|Legacy]]. It is a massive advantage and often a much-desired benefit for mages without [[Legacies]].
