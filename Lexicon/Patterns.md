When a mage speaks of a person’s “[[Life]] Pattern,” she means the total information available to the [[Life]] [[Arcanum]] about that person — his health, physicality, age, hunger, disease, and any supernatural effects influencing those things.

The individual symbols that make up a Pattern are referred to as [[Forms]].

Patterns as a monolith make up the [[Tapestry]].
