_The “spun” time of the past is both more certain and useful to examine with magic but harder to affect, as a mage must contend with the weight of all the intervening history._

---

Much as two subjects may have sympathetic links crossing [[Space]] marking how magically related they are, a subject has temporal sympathy with its own past selves, which influences magic used with a past version of an object, place, or thing as its subject.\
The more a subject has changed in the intervening time, the harder it is for a mage to look back at it but the easier it is to affect that sympathy itself.

Just as [[Space]] magic that alters sympathetic links has consequences for the people or objects concerned, manipulating temporal sympathy can provoke subtle effects; increase a woman’s temporal sympathy with her youth and she’ll become highly nostalgic, perhaps trying to recapture it.\
Destroy a building’s temporal sympathy with its past and people will forget its history.

Magic that affects the “unspun” time of the future is unaffected by temporal sympathy; the shifting potential timelines have no “substance” for magic to contend with.

## Temporal Sympathy Level

### Unchanged

The subject has not changed with intervening time. A sealed room left untouched, a diamond in the same setting, a person who has not spoken to anyone or been anywhere since the target time. The connection is unassailable without [[Practice of Unmaking|Unmaking]] magic and casting using the sympathy is not Withstood.

- **Withstand (Connection):** 5 ("Unchanged" Sympathy may only be removed with [[Practice of Unmaking|Unmaking]] spells)
- **Withstand (Temporal Sympathy):** 0

### Strong

The subject has not significantly changed; a person days later who has not changed physically, or hours after an injury, a street after hours of foot traffic or a building after days of habitation, a gun that has been fired.

- **Withstand (Connection):** 3
- **Withstand (Temporal Sympathy):** 1

### Medium

The subject has significantly changed; a mage before joining a Legacy, a person before a prolonged illness, an item that has been broken or built, a street after several businesses have changed, a building under new ownership.

- **Withstand (Connection):** 2
- **Withstand (Temporal Sympathy):** 2

### Weak

The subject is vastly different; a mage before her [[Awakening]], an item before being imbued, a different building on the same lot, a ruin when it was new.

- **Withstand (Connection):** 1
- **Withstand (Temporal Sympathy):** 3
