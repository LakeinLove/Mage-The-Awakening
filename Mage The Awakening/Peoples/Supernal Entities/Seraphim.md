_Manifest Angels of [[Aether]], the Seraphim are beings of [[Forces]] that can be called upon with a [[Summoning]]._

---

Many resemble their resplendent and terrifying namesakes, complete with shining swords and magnificent wings. 

Others appear as pillars of fire, roiling pools of water, cascades of light, or other elemental phenomena. \
Mages call them up for assistance with matters of elemental magic, advice on making war, or questions of virtue and morality.
