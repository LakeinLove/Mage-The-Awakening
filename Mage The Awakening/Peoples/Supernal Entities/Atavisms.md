_Manifest Beasts of the [[Primal Wild]], the Atavisms are beings of [[Life]] that can be called upon with a [[Summoning]]._

---

These monsters are always primal, brutal, and operating according to animal instinct. 

They can provide mages with material components for spells and magical items that can’t be found anywhere on Earth, as well as advice or information about animals and plants that haven’t existed in the Fallen World for millions of years (or ever).\
They can also provide knowledge and inspiration for ways to use the Life Arcanum to change shape, techniques that the mage never would have considered on her own.
