_Recondite Shades of [[Stygia]], the Spectres are beings of [[Death]] that can be called upon with a [[Summoning]]_

---

Mages call them up for advice on matters of mortality (or, conversely, immortality), loss, grief, the wisdom of the dead, lost civilizations, and the Underworld. 

They often resemble beings traditionally associated with death â€” spectral, robed figures, black dogs, crows, maggots, or obviously dead people.\
Sometimes they take the form of deities of death (Hades, Baron Samedi, Mrtyu-Mara, etc.)
