_Recondite Fae of [[Arcadia]], the Moirae are beings of [[Fate]] that can be called upon with a [[Summoning]]._

---

These beings manifest in a myriad of different ways â€” human beings, balls of energy, or simply a palpable sense of potential with no visual component at all. 

Mages call Moirae up to ask about their own destinies, to make deals to change their fortunes, or to try to cheat fate. \
Moirae very often turn the tables on such hubris, however.
