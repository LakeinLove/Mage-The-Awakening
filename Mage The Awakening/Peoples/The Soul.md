The Soul is as simple to describe as it is impossible to truly comprehend: It is the essence of a person, the thing that gives them love, joy, pain, loss, vitality, curiosity, and liveliness. It is the connection to the world and the central part of their ability to use magic.

A soul can be lost, and it causes someone to gradually degenerate into a husk of a person, a being with no desires nor fears. Truly hollow.

It is with the soul one is Awakened, it is with the soul that one lives and breathes, and it is with the soul that one passes on from this world.
