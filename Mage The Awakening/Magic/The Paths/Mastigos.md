## Ruling Arcana

[[Mind]] and [[Space]].\
Passions and the connections. The unknown reaches of the soul, manifest in hidden places in the world. 

To understand the Mastigos approach to [[Mind]], cast off the notion that consciousness is an inner advisor, babbling your thoughts. The true self is calm and transcendent, beyond even the debatable concept of the superego. It never strives, but is the path of a river, the layout of mind-palaces. A Psychonaut places himself above thoughts, wrangling their goetic manifestations to do her bidding, and reaches out with transcendental clarity to touch the thoughts of others. 

Warlocks rattle the chains of connection: the true nature of [[Space]], instead of what [[Sleepers]] measure with yardsticks and maps. A Master of [[Space]] shrinks them to black iron threads, finely wrought, often tangled, and easily severed.

## Inferior Arcanum

[[Matter]]\
Matter sticks in the conceptual gullet of the Mastigos.\
It seems to populate [[Lie|the Lie]] alone, a too-solid illusion to fill the empty spaces between [[Sleepers]]. Yet “base” elements undeniably possess Supernal vibrations and have a claim to the world of truth. Mastigos find it difficult to understand [[Matter]]’s faint, unthinking hum.

## Symbols and Myths

The Devil and Temperance. Demons and wrathful gods. Serenity and decadence. 

In the [[Awakened]] Tarot, Mastigos map their experience to two contrasting cards. The Devil represents a Warlock’s passions. Everyone carries an annex of [[Pandemonium]] where their desires dwell, but Mastigos not only possess a strong inner menagerie, but the clarity to name and subjugate its inmates. 

Their [[Mystery]] card is Temperance: the path of control and sign of the psychopomp who guides souls between worlds. Despite the initial victory of [[Awakening]], suppressing the Goetia is a lifelong struggle, waged through raw determination, meditative calm, and occasional bribery — feeding your passions can calm them, for a time. Mastigos may take the most direct approach to magical praxes. They treat gods and demons like states of mind to be conjured, propitiated, and bound at need. Yet they do not regard these beings as illusory — as the Astral realms demonstrate, thought is as real as flesh. Warlocks make pantheons of consciousness out of Qlippothic anti-angels and wrathful Tibetan deities. They appear beautiful or fearsome based on the summoner’s state of mind or the thoughts they symbolize. 

Meditative Mastigos approach with a still mind, hoping to coax bodhisattvas out of fanged, skull-bearing gods. Iron-willed Warlocks confront their Goetia at their most hideous — the more threatening they appear, the more power they offer. The [[Path]]’s chief concern is the problem of the self. Mastigos cast off the illusion that they’re nothing but urges and emotions. After sifting them out, what remains? 

Psychonauts breathe and chant mantras to banish lingering biases or rebuild themselves anew, creating gods and sigils that represent who they need to be to perform a particular task. Warlocks devote themselves to antinomian struggle. They define themselves by who they are not. To conquer lust, they fuck. To defeat venality, they hoard wealth. Both approaches present risks ranging from apathy to decadence. The sorcerer erases everything that makes her vital or feeds the Goetia too well, and lets them take over.

## Warlocks in the Orders

[[Adamantine Arrow]]:\
After battling rogue thoughts, Mastigos enter the [[Adamantine Arrow]] understanding some of the challenges to come. They approach oaths and the chain of command with less enthusiasm. They didn’t master their urges to bend knee before some officer. They’d rather be loyal out of love or a real sense of duty than a set of ritual protocols. Nevertheless, they see into souls or secret places as spies and scouts. They plague enemies with psychic horrors and delusions.

[[Free Council]]:\
Mastigos [[Free Council|Libertines]] believe that everyone should be allowed to transform his or her own soul without Hierarchs and other titled fools twisting it to suit their ambitions. [[Sleepers]] follow gurus and priests in search of happy, calm minds. Mastigos play the part with an advantage: They can truly peer into your psyche. They provide the help [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] mystics falsely promise, though they can inflict abuse unimagined by the worst cult leaders, too.

[[Guardians of the Veil]]:\
Mastigos understand how difficult it is to [[Awakening|Awaken]] without submitting to the soul’s weaknesses. Give up yourself, become pure, and guard the Awakened against anyone unable to make the same commitment. Mastigos [[Guardians of the Veil|Guardians]] excel at interrogation, surveillance, and assuming false identities.

[[Mysterium]]:\
Magic not only lives, but possesses a soul made of [[Awakened]] wants and frailties. An Imago is what magic thinks. Spells driven by blind impulses, hatred, and obsessive love corrupt the Supernal mind of sorcery. Therefore, a Mastigos serves the Order by acting as a moral gatekeeper, and examines [[Mystery|Mysteries]] for ethical implications. Although this task normally drives such [[Mysterium|Mystagogues]] to talk to people instead of examining strange sites and artifacts, [[Space]] allows Mastigos to enter inaccessible places and examine their sympathetic connections, leaving a role for occult archaeologists.

[[Silver Ladder]]:\
Rule yourself to rule others. That describes more than a best practice — it’s the right to govern, for the allegorical Cave represents more than intellectual ignorance. It’s the darkness cast by desire, cloaking unpleasant truths. Leaders need to drag the flock out by ministering to their fears, encouraging their ambitions, and suffocating their destructive urges.

[[Seers of the Throne]]:\
They see your weakness and hate you for it. They know why the [[Seers of the Throne|Throne]] needs to keep you ignorant, limited to sins of the Fallen flesh. Mastigos Watchers respect the Eye, the Exarch of Space and power of surveillance. People who know they’re being watched tend to behave. Channelling the Unity, Exarch of Mind, Watchers strip dissent from resistant minds to better serve the [[Seers of the Throne|Throne]].
