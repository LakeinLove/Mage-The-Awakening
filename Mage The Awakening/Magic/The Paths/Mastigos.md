Bonded to the [[Watchtower of the Iron Gauntlet]] in [[Pandemonium]]

Nimbus: "Nightmarish", often distorting visible space and view, as well as myriad sensations such as exotic fragrances and unseen flames. As they become more intense distant screams or howls of pain can be heard.

The Mastigos, epitomized by the tarot of "The Devil", walk the Path of Scourging, though the hell-scape that is Pandemonium, often called the Realm of Nightmares.

Pandemonium brings dreaded dreams to Sleepers, where echoes of its madness seep into their minds; their worst fears and repressed emotions brought forth to be examined and judged. It exists to expunge a soul, scouring it of sins and purifying it to rejoin the divine.

Warlocks, as the mages who walk this path are called, are oft associated with diabolists and demons, though they are more often masters of those infernal urges; those who by a mere thought quell their unsavory thoughts and seek to elevate themselves and others.
The manipulation of thoughts, emotions, memory combined with the ability to understand and warp space make Mastigos laudable allies and fearsome enemies; none have wills as honed and tempered as the Mastigos.

They are often masters of spying and manipulation, using their knowledge of people and interactions to their sole advantage; a feat for which their reputations often suffer. They are subtle, cautious, and people-minded: a Mastigos thinks more of the who than the what.

Mastigos are always the most amplified by their awakening: people with cruel and chaotic personalities will be able to use these powers to dominate and sow discord, while those with beneficent dispositions will gain the ability to apply those traits with equal facility.

## Appearance
Mastigos, more often than not, place great emphasis on their appearance, many going as far to ensure they make good impressions by dressing and grooming themselves in styles that those they wish to befriend find proper. 
Proper etiquette, good grooming, immense self-discipline, these are all tools a Mastigos uses to their advantage.

## Common Backgrounds
Warlocks of Pandemonium are often those who are devout in their beliefs, whose strongly held views have been hard-earned and refined. They are often people with powerful personalities and wills even before awakening, using manipulation and people-skills to get what they want. They come from all walks of life, be they writers who feel as if they speak to your soul with their works, mental health professionals who have incredible success records, or sociopaths who use others for their own benefit, they all have influence in their own ways.
