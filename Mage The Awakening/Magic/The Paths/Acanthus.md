Favoured Resistance Attribute: [[Composure]]

_A mage whose [[Path]] leads to [[Arcadia]]. Also known as Witches or Enchanters._
## Ruling Arcana
[[Fate]] and [[Time]]. \
They’re the root powers of destiny: Arcadian energies that turn the Wheel of Fortune. Witchcraft is the art of shaping destiny. 

As a subtle [[Arcanum]], [[Fate]] is part of every soul, the vessel containing its ultimate purpose. Like Merlin (a name Acanthus say was a title), they study and draw forth potential. Like the Mórríoghan who laid Cú Chulainn low, they turn [[Fate]] against itself with curses and oaths that trap the fools who swear them. 

[[Time]] is the loom that spins [[Fate]] into action. Acanthus part the Mists of possibility to predict portentous events. To Witches, these are scenes in a mythic story. [[Arcadia]] teaches that lives are legends, so as tricksters, allies, and prophets, they predict and shape pivotal moments — a role that puts them on the outside of great stories, setting the stage but rarely wielding the hero’s sword.

## Inferior Arcanum
[[Forces]] \
Lightning arrives at its appointed time in the tale, not before. \
In Arcadia, elemental powers are visible manifestations of destiny and Fae passions. Fire isn’t heat alone, but the anger of the Fair Folk or the climax of an apocalyptic myth; it is not to be raised through some mechanistic act of will.

## Symbols and Myths
The Fool and the Wheel of Fortune. Tricksters, fairies, and witches. Stories of curses, blessings, and great destinies. Wishes and bargains. 

In the Awakened Tarot, the Acanthus personifies the Fool: a trackless soul, able to move freely through the currents of destiny. Witches don’t get to this state through naïve wandering, but by unburdening themselves of old attachments, and using magic to slip the grasp of new ones. \
Their Mysteries involve the Wheel of Fortune, a card depicting the relentless spin of destiny. There’s no still place to stand in the world, no equilibrium to be had. Even Acanthus can’t just grab a spoke of the Wheel to get to a favourable situation. A Witch needs to get to the right place at the right time to nudge things just so. The further she is from the ideal opportunity, the more she needs to push — with stronger, more dangerous sorcery.

Witches are well known for invoking Supernal Fae, but do not worship them. The Fair Folk respond to bargains and payments, not one-sided adulation (which as something given for free they enjoy, but never answer with favours). Modern Fae can take any shape. Many Acanthus invent personal fairy idols to attune themselves to Arcadia. Beyond personal inventions, Witches structure magic around trickster figures. 

Tricksters demonstrate the value of breaking conventions, but also illustrate why those conventions exist. Coyote gets punished in the end, and the gods bound Loki with his son’s entrails. Acanthus need not use tricksters alone, however. Some prefer gods and signs of duty, destiny, and moral obligation. Acanthus rituals recall stories where luck, fate, obligations, and strong consequences come to the fore. Their spells are jinn-wishes with unintended consequences, or awful promises that must be kept. They recreate stories where heroes die from errant wordplay. Macbeth fits the pattern of an Acanthus legend. When Yudhishthira throws the dice to lose again and again, the tale follows Acanthus logic.

## Witches in the Orders
[[Adamantine Arrow]]: \
The Fallen World preys on hope and human potential. Acanthus see the mighty unwritten destinies; the [[Adamantine Arrow|Arrow]] trains them to defend these seeds of power. In return, Acanthus enhance [[Adamantine Arrow|Arrow]] zeal with efficiency. They’re the blow to the pressure point, the bullet to the eye socket, the charge to the weak flank.

[[Free Council]]: \
We make our own fate; time is a ticking clock, a human breath, and moments of pain and love that stretch beyond objective measurement. The [[Free Council]] wants everyone to walk the Fool’s path, to shake off the Lie of oppressive systems and the compromises they force people to make with their true selves. Their Acanthus free people to explore their true destinies — to a point. Freedom is precious, but dangerous. We make our own fate, but produce our own evil.

[[Guardians of the Veil]]: \
Horrors incubate inside foolish actions. The power to save or topple the world blazes in every soul. Some should be encouraged, but others need to be swaddled in ignorance, so they cannot even conceive of power, lest they abuse it. Acanthus sense these dangers before anyone else, and have the Art to deal with them quietly. Peering through time, they can see why the Order does its work in disastrous possible futures. They cut away these diseased, unborn fates to let a better world flourish.

[[Mysterium]]: \
The Wheel of Fortune is the pulse of living magic. Occult physicians, [[Mysterium|Mystagogues]] preserve magic’s health by helping some Arts grow, and amputating forms that show signs of disease. Acanthus can sense when a sorcerer’s ready for a new secret, or whether certain events must take place to prepare her, making them ideal mentors. They’re notorious for speaking in riddles and demanding strange ordeals to produce mages worthy of the Mysteries.

[[Silver Ladder]]: \
Religions live and die by their prophets. The [[Silver Ladder|Ladder]] is a faith of sorts, devoted to humanity’s secret divinity. It values Acanthus not just as practical oracles, but as those who predict when people Awaken to godhood. Every mage is a messiah, and every messiah needs a Baptist, to purify him and charge him with duties.

[[Seers of the Throne]]: \
Masterminds, manipulators, and decadents, Seer Acanthus hone their senses of entitlement into unshakable articles of faith. Foresight trumps force, and Seer Visionaries possess more of the former than anyone else. They honour the Ruin, Exarch of Fate, who tells them lesser people might as well serve a purpose while they march to doom. They’re favourites of the Prophet of Time: anointed Great Men who make history.
