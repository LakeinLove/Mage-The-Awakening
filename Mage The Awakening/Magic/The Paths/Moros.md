Inferior Arcanum: [[Spirit]]

Nimbus: "Haunting", Often images of a blurry figure or deeper shadows indicate casting, with things looking decayed or rotten under closer inspection. With more power, people can hear whispers of long-forgotten voices and a chill seeping through the world.

The Path of Doom, the path of transition and transformation, that rules over death and matter themselves. The tarot card of "Death" is their mark, and they are always associated with conceptual ideas that fill the minds of others in their presence.

A Moros Necromancer is so much more than simple death, as death is merely the moment of transition from one form to another in a greater whole. They can use alchemy to surpass any normal limits of supply and demand, and their knowledge of detritivores and ecological recycling is only really challenged by the [[Thyrsus]]. 

Knowing death is ever coming, the Moros often bemoan wasting time and quickly use their skills of alchemy to transmute any of their needs out of mundane materials, able to create real, permanent gold from random objects and useless knickknacks.

The transitory boundaries that so fascinate them often include things like when a lake becomes a river, where day becomes night, and where ignorance becomes knowledge, which often results in them being incredibly knowledgeable about even the most esoteric things.

As commanders of death itself they wield all that conceptually belongs to it, including shadows, darkness, cold, and even animative forces. A Moros mage can raise the dead, preserve anything, cloak themselves in darkness and embrace shadows in all their forms. A Moros utilising death is a terrifying sight to behold, as masters of this Arcana often have a deep understanding of the end of all things. It should never be forgotten that entropy also falls under their command, and once one has felt all of the light, heat, and sound dissipate from a space they will never doubt the terror of an angry Moros.

Their matter abilities are often more easily understood, but no less feared and admired. The ability to change any matter into another, to break cohesion between things, to have access to any material one could ever need? Truly it is a power worthy of the shepherds of change themselves.

## Appearance
The Moros tend to be rather reverent people, ones who know what values and things are to be held dear, and what are simply passing thoughts, ready to change any moment. They value rituals and culture, especially around death, as often it is the most dramatic change that occurs, which leads to them dressing in whatever colours their culture deems appropriate for mourning.
This being said, often Necromancers also find joy in the ever-transitory nature of reality and wear bright cheerful colours just to change it up on their peers.
They often appear wise and contemplative, and are sparkling conversationalists around any esoteric or complicated and nuanced topic.

## Common Backgrounds
All mages who awaken as Necromancers almost always have an uncommon connection to death, the dead, and massive change. Survivors of war and genocide, philosophers, environmental scientists, doctors, soldiers, and serial killers often line the ranks of the Moros. The Moros also share the company of plutocrats, suppliers, and those who provide for large numbers of people.
