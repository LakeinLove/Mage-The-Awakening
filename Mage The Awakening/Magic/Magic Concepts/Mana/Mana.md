_Mana is the palpable, measurable bleed of the Supernal into the material. It’s a Prime energy, a quintessential force that comes from the energy trapped when the Abyss came into existence, or sometimes comes into existence from the glory and greatness of the world._

In a Hallow, it can suffuse a physical object, forming tass. \
Mages can keep a certain amount of Mana in their Patterns depending on their Gnosis dots. Alternatively, tass can be physically held and carried around in whatever quantities the mage can stockpile.

A Mage’s Gnosis determines her Pattern’s capacity for Mana storage, but it also determines how quickly she can spend it. Consult the Gnosis chart for these numbers.

_Mana can be spent as a reflexive action to:_
- Improvise a spell not based on your character’s Ruling Arcana. Improvising a spell outside your character’s Ruling Arcana requires a point of Mana.
- Reduce Paradox risk on a spell by one die per point of Mana spent.
- Attainments often cost Mana to activate, as noted in their rules.
- Some powerful spells that push the boundaries of natural physics or violate the Lie require Mana.

### Pattern Restoration

As an instant action, a mage can bolster her Pattern and heal mentally or physically. Three Mana points can heal a level of bashing or lethal damage. Alternatively, the mage can remove a Mental Condition (this does not offer a Beat) or a Physical Tilt.

Mages attempting a feat that requires Mana above their Gnosis-derived spending limits may take as many Turns as needed before the action to spend the required Mana. If they are interrupted or change their minds part-way through, Mana spent is still lost.
