_Mages can absorb Mana through numerous methods:_
- The most common method is [[Oblation]], or targeted meditation at a [[Hallow]]. This requires a [[Gnosis]] + [[Composure]] roll and one hour’s time. Each success gives one [[Mana]], up to the limits imposed by the [[Hallow]]. As well, a mage with a [[Legacy]] can commit a special [[Oblation]] even away from a [[Hallow]].
- Mages with three dots of [[Prime]] may use the spell [[Channel Mana]] to absorb [[Mana]] from a [[Hallow]] without [[Oblation]].
- If [[Mana]] is left to accumulate at a [[Hallow]], it’ll eventually congeal and crystallize into tass, which can be stored and accessed later. If the tass congeals in food, it can be eaten to absorb the [[Mana]]. Otherwise, [[Channel Mana]] is required to access tass.
- Moments of Supernal Revelation can generate [[Mana]]. This usually means fulfilling an [[Obsession]].
- A mage can Scour her [[Pattern]] for [[Mana]], literally tearing apart some of the building blocks that maintain her physical form. This shreds her mortal body, but the resulting release produces Mana. In game terms, she reduces a Physical Attribute (and all traits derived from it, such as Health for Stamina) by one dot for 24 hours, or suffers one resistant lethal wound. This produces three Mana. At Gnosis 1–4, she can Scour once per day. At 5–6, she can Scour twice. At 7–9, she can Scour three times per day. And at Gnosis 10, she can Scour four times per day.
- Lastly, Blood Sacrifice offers Mana. In an [[Act of Hubris]], the mage kills a living being for Mana. Its death releases Mana from its Pattern. A small animal offers one Mana, while human sacrifices offer as much Mana as the person had Integrity dots remaining before the killing blow. The Mana gained from Sacrifice ignores the spend per Turn limits on Mana if the sacrifice is part of a spell’s casting.
