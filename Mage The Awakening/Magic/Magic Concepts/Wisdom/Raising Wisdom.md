_A mage can improve their Wisdom as a culmination of their experiences_

---

Through effort, a mage who has become worried about his worsening Paradoxes may turn away from the downward slide of hubris. \
A mage attempting spiritual self-improvement must assign “Becoming wiser” as one of her Obsessions, working to understand her place in the universe. 

After at least one story with progress on this Obsession, the player may spend two Arcane Experiences to add a dot of Wisdom.
