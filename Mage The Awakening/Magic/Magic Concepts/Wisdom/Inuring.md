_Inuring allows a mage to become immunised to a spell's [[wisdom]]-damaging effects, but in return makes it a Paradox magnet_

---

If a mage suffers [[Wisdom]] loss through use of a spell, she can choose to wipe that spell from future [[Act of Hubris|Acts of Hubris]]; any future uses will not incur [[Wisdom]] loss no matter the action. 

If she chooses to do this, to inure herself to the spellâ€™s [[Act of Hubris|Hubris]], it forever becomes a Paradox risk.\
From that point forward, every use of the inured spell forces a base two-die Paradox risk. Your character may inure herself to the effects of one spell per dot of her [[Gnosis]].
