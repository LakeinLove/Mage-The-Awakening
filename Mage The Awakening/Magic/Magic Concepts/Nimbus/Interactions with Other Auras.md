_Other supernatural creatures tend to have aura effects that force Conditions. Sometimes this is a defence mechanism; sometimes this is a way to assert dominance._

However, mages are particularly resistant to this effect. When such an effect targets your character, roll a dice pool comprised of a Resistance [[Attribute]] + [[Gnosis]]. The Resistance [[Attribute]] depends on the monster’s dice pool:\
If it uses [[Strength]], roll [[Stamina]]; if [[Presence]], roll [[Composure]]; and if [[Intelligence]], roll [[Resolve]]. 

This resistance is automatic, but it does count as flaring your character’s [[Immediate Nimbus]]. This comes with all effects, both positive and negative. The roll acts as a contested action against whatever the other character throws at yours. Your successes subtract from his; if you net any successes beyond his, he suffers your [[Nimbus]] [[Tilt]].
