_Every mage has a Nimbus — a spiritual signature heavily influenced by her Path and Legacy but as unique to her as her DNA. Whenever a mage casts a spell, her Nimbus flares, revealing her to any mage using his Sight_

---

A Nimbus is more than something revealed when the mage casts a spell.

Even after the mage’s spell fades, her Nimbus lingers on the subject like a fingerprint that can be traced to her by other mages. \
A mage may also deliberately reveal her Nimbus, even to Sleepers, to impress or intimidate, although doing so provokes Quiescence.

Finally, every mage’s Nimbus subtly twists the lives of everyone and everything connected to the mage and makes them more closely reflect her Nimbus. \
In order to isolate their Sleeping families and loved ones from the effects of their Nimbuses, most mages adopt Shadow Names.
