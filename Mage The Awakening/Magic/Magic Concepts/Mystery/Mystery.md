_A Mystery is that which begs to be explored and understood. They are hunted and solved by Mages in order to extend the Mage's understanding of the [[Supernal]]_

There is one hard rule of Magic:
- It cannot be fully learned without being experienced.

Magic leaves the practitioner transformed, and the journey of encountering the mysterious and exploring it is as important to a mage’s development as whatever rush she feels at the end of the trail when something’s been pinned down and understood.

And the world is teeming with Mysteries.

The ubiquity of [[High Speech]] in the [[Fallen World]] is only one of the many phenomena mages describe as the Mysteries. \
In essence, the Mysteries are that which begs to be explored and understood. The journey along the paths or symbols that accompany [[Awakening]] is only the beginning of the mage’s exploration of the Mysteries. \
He cannot increase his understanding of the [[Supernal]] power he wields except by seeking them out and experiencing them. Books and mentors can put a mage on the scent of a Mystery, but they cannot bestow the spiritual epiphany a direct encounter offers.

Old, European magical societies started calling what a mage experiences when chasing magic a “Mystery Play” — a story with a symbolic moral at the end. Every Mystery solved is a miniature reminder of the Awakening, when the mage first saw through the Lie.

Chasing a Mystery is intoxicating to a mage, and the journey itself is in many ways the destination. Even those Mysteries that cannot be easily solved can help a mage grow stronger in her [[Path]], applying her experiences to magic.

The [[Tapestry]] is vast and filled with Mysteries great and small. Although many have direct, obvious connections to the [[Supernal]], most do not. \
Nothing external forces a mage to pursue the Mysteries, but those who do not have a natural curiosity and a willingness to go to great lengths to satisfy it simply do not [[Awakening|Awaken]]. 

Mages see the world more deeply than Sleepers do, and when they notice something abnormal or out of place they feel an unmistakable impulse to examine it more closely.
