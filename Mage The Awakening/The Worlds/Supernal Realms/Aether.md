The Ruling Arcana of Aether are the Gross Arcanum [[Forces]] and the Subtle Arcanum[[Prime]].

Only those truly elect may bask in the radiance of Aether, guarded by the Hosts with their swords of flame and righteousness. Lightning spears though the sky, as the Flame Supernal tests the mettle of everyone who wishes to weird its power. 

Those not shielded by a divine purpose are burned and scorched for even touching the realm's raw power. The power of the Prime Materia, the very fire of Creation that fuels reality itself is born and meted out here by Providence.
