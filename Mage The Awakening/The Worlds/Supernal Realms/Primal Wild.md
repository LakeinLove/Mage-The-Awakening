The Primal Wild is home to the [[Watchtower of the Stone Book]] and the endpoint for the [[Thyrsus]] [[path]].

The Ruling Arcana of the Primal Wild are the Gross Arcanum [[Life]] and the Subtle Arcanum [[Spirit]].

This place speaks to the primordial in all beings, enticing them to lose themselves to the ecstasies of the flesh or spirit; exalting in the very act of being. The pounding drums of the heart and lungs, the surging blood in every vein, the tingling nerves and salty sweat - all these things are the alphabet of desire presided over by this realm. The Primal Wild is often claimed to bless all wine and drink, the drunken madness that sets in a response to its humid embrace.

All of the grandeur and horror of the nature both within and without mortals thrums within this plane.
