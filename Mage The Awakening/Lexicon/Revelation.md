_Revelation is an instant action. It can be undertaken when a mage first encounters a [[Mystery]], revealing only the surface information, and also when a mage has unravelled some or all of the Mystery’s Opacity._

### Roll Results

#### Dramatic Failure

The player overloads her own perceptions and the subject of her study with [[Mana]], akin to spilling a bottle of ink on a page she was deciphering. No [[Scrutiny]] or Revelation of that subject is possible — by any mage — for the next 24 hours. The [[Prime]] spell “Cleanse Pattern” can dissolve the [[Mana]] before then, allowing further [[Scrutiny]].

#### Failure

The mage is unable to Reveal anything about the subject. She can still attempt to Scrutinize it, however.

#### Success

The mage discovers the surface information of the [[Mystery]].

#### Exceptional Success

The mage discovers the surface information of the [[Mystery]] and can either lower the Mystery’s [[Opacity]] rating by 1, or, at the Storyteller’s discretion, uncover one piece of deep information.
