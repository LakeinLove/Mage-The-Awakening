  - The Lie
---
_The Lie is the fundamental conception that the current world that Sleepers see is all there is to the world. The Lie is an all-encompassing blanket upon every sense and thought for every person._

---

People imagine that the world they can touch and see is real — more real than pure concepts. The abstract only exists to define the concrete. This world is all there is, a cruel, oppressive regime that grinds souls down with a thousand tyrannies. \
A whispering voice in the back of the head saying: \
_You’re worthless. You’re only human. Don’t look. Concentrate on surviving the here and now._

**This** is the Lie. A falsehood, created by invisible enemies from the symbolism of oppression and the Paradoxical energies of an [[Abyss]] of untruth. Mages Awaken when they confront the Lie, when they look deep inside themselves, or are shocked outside of themselves and see past the Lie to the symbols beneath.

The [[Fallen World]] is this Lie, hiding the [[Tapestry]] of truth that is the [[Supernal World]].

It is believed that the masterminds behind this Lie are called the [[Exarchs]], the architects of the Lie.
