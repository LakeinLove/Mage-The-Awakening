_The Path of a mage refers to which of the 5 major paths they traverse in order to regain and maintain their connection to the [[Supernal]]_

---

The 5 Paths are: 
- [[Acanthus]]
- [[Mastigos]]
- [[Moros]]
- [[Obrimos]]
- [[Thyrsus]]

A path is the means by which a Mage casts spells.\
It is a massive, theoretically near-infinite set of magical symbols that the mage can sense and understand.
