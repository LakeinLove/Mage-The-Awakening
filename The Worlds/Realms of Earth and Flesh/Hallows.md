_The phenomenal world may be a Lie, but it still relies on Supernal forces. The strongest channels of power lead to places of symbolic importance._

This is directly connected to the [[Hallow]] Merit.

These Hallows trigger a mage’s mystic senses, and may be further examined with [[Prime]] to determine their strength and if any ley lines intersect with them. Even without ley lines, a Hallow is a special place.\
Things just seem more real in its vicinity, searing themselves into long-term memory like the first taste of a rare fruit. Hallows can be found on mountain peaks, deep caves, and anywhere in between, but always seem to be located near unique features, or in places that seem to be the epitome of their environments: deep, old growth forests and sinister cracks in the earth, not tree farms and anonymous ditches.

Mages harvest Mana from a Hallow by either performing oblations there, or harvesting tass: Mana that fills material forms. The type of tass that manifests depends on the Hallow’s physical and symbolic characteristics, as Mana that hasn’t been otherwise harvested merges with the environment. Tass is the water from a sacred spring, or stones chipped from the summit of a mountain.

When people change the Hallow’s environment, tass is slow to conform. Cap the spring, and sacred water still pools around the concrete. It takes time, and reawakening from a prolonged period of dormancy, for a Hallow’s tass to assume a new form.

## System

The Hallow Merit represents reliable access to a Hallow and gives the rules for Mana and tass production. Powerful Hallows (3 dots or greater) almost always intersect with ley lines. [[Prime]] spells can connect ley lines to Hallows of any strength however, to imbue them with a specific Resonance. Thus, many Hallows are also Nodes.
