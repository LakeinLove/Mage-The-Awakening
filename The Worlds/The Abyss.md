_The Abyss is the realm that Lies, sitting like a pustulent sore between the Supernal and the Fallen_

---

The Abyss is the unknowable space between realities, the realm that has shards in every [[Sleepers|Sleeper]] soul, the embodiment of everything that cannot be.\
It is the antithesis to the Supernal, used by the [[Peoples/Exarchs|Exarchs]] to poison and manipulate the Fallen World and its inhabitants.

The Abyss is the origin of the [[Lie]], [[Quiescence]], [[Dissonance]], and all [[Paradox]]. Anything that challenges [[Lie|The Lie]] draws its power into the Fallen World, and if a mage is not careful - if they do not enforce their Will with Wisdom - then it will warp and twist their spellcasting.
