Housing the [[Watchtower of the Iron Gauntlet]], and final resting point for the [[Path]] of the [[Mastigos]], Pandemonium is a plane of chaos and madness.

The Ruling Arcana of Pandemonium are the Gross Arcanum [[Space]] and the Subtle Arcanum [[Magic/Arcana/Mind]].

Often called the Realm of Nightmares, this haunting plane purifies the souls who enter it with a scouring gaze of judgement, prompting one to reflect on themselves under the scrutiny.

Every corner of the mind is laid bare, and yet every path is everchanging and impenetrable.
