_The world of Sleep; [[Lie|the Lie]] made manifest; the Material realm. The Fallen World is the world in which we all live._

The Fallen World is the concrete, perceivable world around us.\
Despite their [[Gnosis]], mages are trapped in the Fallen World, able to look but never touch the Supernal.

Enforcing their wills and Supernal Truths upon the Fallen World is, in essence, the foundation of magic.

The Fallen World includes:
- The Material World
- [[The Underworld]]
- [[The Astral Realms]]
- [[The Shadow]]
