_Spirits are bizarre beings created by Resonance and driven by hunger for Essence._

---

Spirits are [[Ephemeral Entities]], and use all stats and abilities found under that descriptor.

Spirits need the spiritual Resonance of the area or host to match their own.

Everything in the world has a spiritual reflection â€” not just physical objects such as trees or cars, but strong emotions and significant events as well.

The only thing that lacks this reflection is humanity itself, but the actions and passions of humankind provide a bounty of Essence for ravenous throngs of spirits.

The home realm of spirits is [[The Shadow]].
