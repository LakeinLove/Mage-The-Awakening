_Goetia are entities of pure thought and concept._

---

Goetia are [[Ephemeral Entities]], and use all stats and abilities found under that descriptor.

Goetia cannot naturally Manifest, and must be granted the ability to do so through magic.

Some Goetia dwell within the shared consciousness of humanity, birthed from ideas and beliefs of the people of the Fallen World; others live within the mind of the individual â€” daemons and figments that make up the psyche.

The home realm of Goetia is [[The Astral Realms]].
