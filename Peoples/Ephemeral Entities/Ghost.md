_Ghosts are born of death, the remnants of humans who have perished in sudden or traumatic fashion._

---

Ghosts are [[Ephemeral Entities]], and use all stats and abilities found under that descriptor.

A ghost requires Anchors â€” the places, objects, and people linked to its living days that reinforce its sense of identity.

Many ghosts are shattered, insensate phantasms locked into an eternal replay of their deaths, but others are spiteful terrors fully cogent of their lifeless torment and eager to share their misery.

Ghosts are common wherever humanity is to be found, clinging to physical Anchors of their former lives, but they are drawn through [[Irises]] to [[The Underworld]].
