_Ephemeral Entities are the Denizens of Other Realms that are not [[Supernal Entities]]._

---

Collectively, Goetia, Spirits, and Ghosts are known as ephemeral entities, after the substance their bodies are made of when in the material world. Ephemera is naturally invisible and intangible, putting the entity into Twilight unless revealed by its own powers or magic.

## Entering the Fallen World

Some entities can force their way into the material world in search of rich sources of spiritual sustenance, to escape from enemies, or to set plans into motion.
Other beings must use existing Irises if they want to cross over.\
Ghosts are born into the material world at the moment of death, but pass on to the Underworld once their Anchors are gone or their purposes complete; that doesn’t stop some restless dead from trying to return again.\
These incursions into reality are rarely beneficial for humankind, who can end up as the playthings and prey of such otherworldly creatures.

Spirits, Ghosts, Goetia, and [[Supernal Entities]] can be called up as servants, warriors, mentors, sources of information, or foci of contemplation and self-betterment. 

Still, these creatures have their own wills and their own agendas, even when suborned by Awakened magic.\
They are the denizens of alien realms and should not be underestimated.

## Manifestation and Possession

In their home realms, ephemeral entities are visible and solid, but in the physical realm the properties of ephemera leave them out of phase in a state called [[Twilight]].

## Ephemeral Traits

### Rank

Every ephemeral and Supernal entity has dots in an Advantage called Rank, which notes how self-aware and powerful the entity is. Rank technically ranges from 1 to 10 dots, but those with more than Rank 5 are overwhelmingly powerful and too alien to the physical world to support themselves with the Conditions that lesser beings use; their presence in a chronicle should come about through critical conjunctions and momentous events.

Rank is used to determine the number of [[Attribute]] dots and the maximum ratings in other game traits that an ephemeral entity can have, as described in the table above. An ephemeral entity can sense the relative Rank of other beings of the same kind, and can attempt to conceal its own Rank with a contested Finesse roll. Success means that the entity appears to be the same Rank as the being it is concealing it from.

Ghosts cannot increase in Rank outside of the Underworld, and come into existence as either Rank 1 or 2 depending on how much self-awareness they have. Ghosts summoned back from the Underworld may be of any Rank.

Goetia, Spirits, and Supernal Entities run the full range of Ranks depending on age, power, and symbolic significance.

### Rank Chart

| Rank | Trait Limits | [[Attribute]] Dots | Maximum Essence/Mana | Numina |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| 1    | 5 dots       | 5-8            | 10                   | 1-3    |
| 2    | 7 dots       | 9-14           | 15                   | 3-5    |
| 3    | 9 dots       | 15-25          | 20                   | 5-7    |
| 4    | 12 dots      | 26-35          | 25                   | 7-9    |
| 5    | 15 dots      | 36-45          | 50                   | 9-11   |

### Essence and Mana

Invisible entities do not need to breathe or to eat; instead they subsist on Essence or Mana. It fuels their existence and serves as a prized currency for barter, bribery, and payment. Each entity has a maximum Mana or Essence rating and an equal number of Mana or Essence points it can spend to achieve effects. Maximum Mana or Essence is determined by Rank.

Ephemeral entities subsist on Essence, while Supernal beings use Mana.

Entities can use Mana or Essence in the following ways:
- Ephemeral entities must spend a point of Essence per day to remain active in the material world. If they run out, they fall into hibernation until something happens to let them regain at least one point, which can be spent on returning to activity. Spirits and Goetia are pushed back into their home realms when they hibernate; ghosts are likewise forced to the Underworld as long as they don’t have any Anchors remaining. A ghost with remaining Anchors will begin to reform at the Anchor closest to where it fell into hibernation. Supernal beings do not spend Mana to remain active, but have much more limited lifespans in the Fallen World.
- In their home realms, Goetia, ghosts, and Supernal Entities regain their Rank in Essence or Mana per day. Spirits are not sustained by the Shadow; they must always find sources of Essence even when in their own world.
- Spirits, Goetia, and ghosts outside of a suitable Condition bleed one point of Essence per hour. Entities that run out of Essence due to bleed suffer a single point of lethal damage then enter hibernation. Supernal entities lose Corpus over time regardless of their remaining Mana.
- Entities can spend Essence or Mana to boost their traits for a single scene on a point per dot basis. They can’t boost a single trait by more than Rank + 2 dots; boosting takes a turn and they can only boost a single [[Attribute]] in a turn.
- Entities can sense sources of Essence or Mana appropriate for their needs from up to a mile away. The “Seek” Numen increases this range.
- Ephemeral entities regain one point of Essence per day they are in proximity to any Condition relating to them — ghosts are sustained by staying near their Anchors and spirits in the Shadow feed upon Resonance.
- Ephemeral entities can attempt to steal Essence or Mana from beings of the same type — ghosts from ghosts, spirits from spirits, etc. The attacking entity rolls Power + Finesse, contested by the victim’s Power + Resistance. If the attacker succeeds, it steals up to the successes in Essence or Mana, as long as the victim has Essence or Mana remaining to lose.
- Spirits may attempt to gorge themselves on a source of appropriate Essence. Once per day, when in proximity (even if it’s on the other side of the Gauntlet) to a suitable Condition, a spirit can roll Power + Finesse, regaining successes in Essence. If the spirit is still in the Shadow, the dice pool is penalized according to Gauntlet Strength.

### Attributes and Skills

Invisible entities don’t have the nine Attributes familiar in material characters, but use a simplified set of the Power, Finesse, and Resistance categories other Attributes fall into. The Rank chart earlier in this section gives guidelines on how many total dots an entity should have, and what its trait maximum is.
- Power describes the raw ability of the entity to impose itself on other beings and the world at large. It is used in all rolls that call for Strength, Intelligence, or Presence.
- Finesse describes how deft the entity is at imposing its desires with fine control. It is used for all rolls that call for Dexterity, Wits, or Manipulation.
- Resistance describes how well the entity can avoid imposition from its peers and how easily it is damaged. It is used for all rolls that call for Stamina, Resolve, or Composure.

Ephemeral beings don’t possess skills, but don’t suffer unskilled penalties as long as the actions they’re attempting are appropriate to their natures. They roll the appropriate [[Attribute]] + Rank for actions relating directly to their concepts, or [[Attribute]] + [[Attribute]] for actions like surprise and perception. When rolling [[Attribute]] + Rank for mundane (i.e., not magic) tasks, Supernal entities of Rank 4 or higher have the rote action quality.

### Advantages

Ephemeral entities differ in how they treat Integrity, Virtue, and Vice. Not all of them possess these traits, and those that do treat them differently.

- Ghosts retain their Virtue and Vice from life, but with their effects reversed; a ghost regains all Willpower by fulfilling its Vice once per chapter, and regains one Willpower point a scene by fulfilling its Virtue. A ghost retains the same Integrity score that it had before death, but this score cannot change and the ghost does not suffer breaking points.
- Spirits and Goetia do not have an Integrity trait, Virtue, or Vice. They regain one point of spent Willpower per three points of Essence they consume.
- Supernal Beings possess a Vice and a Virtue, but these Vices and Virtues don’t have to be anything that a human would consider virtuous or wicked — they reflect the pure principles of the Supernal instead. Supernal entities do not have an Integrity trait.

### Other Traits

Because they have simplified traits, ephemeral and Supernal entities calculate derived traits differently than other characters.

#### Corpus

Entities don’t have Health, but measure how intact their form is using Corpus. Permanent Corpus is equal to Resistance + Size and grants Corpus boxes that act like Health boxes, filling when the entity suffers injury. Corpus boxes don’t have wound penalties associated with them.

#### Willpower

Willpower dots are equal to Resistance + Finesse, with a maximum of 10 dots for entities of Rank 1 to 5. As well as the Willpower-gaining methods described above, all entities regain one point of Willpower per day.

#### Initiative

Initiative is equal to Finesse + Resistance.

#### Defence

Defence is equal to Power or Finesse, whichever is lower, except for Rank 1 entities which use the higher of the two Attributes.

#### Speed

Speed is equal to Power + Finesse + a “species” factor. Spirits of inanimate objects usually have a species factor of 0.

#### Size

Entities can be of any size and shape, often growing larger as they become more powerful. Ghosts are usually Size 5.

#### Language

Ghosts know whatever languages they could speak in life, although Rank 1 ghosts rarely have the awareness for communication.

Spirits speak the harsh, strange tongue of the Shadow-World, and often learn the human languages common around their feeding grounds.

Goetia from the Oneiros know the languages of the mind they originate from; Goetia from the Temenos speak whatever languages are appropriate for their concepts or origins.

Supernal beings use [[High Speech]] as a true language of communication, but may also speak a range of other languages if they care to do so.

### Bans and Banes

All ephemeral and Supernal entities suffer from a mystical compulsion known as a ban, a behaviour that the being must or must not perform under certain conditions. Bans increase in both complexity and consequences with Rank.

#### Bans

##### Rank 1

Rank 1 entities have mild bans that are easily triggered but don’t endanger the being. A spirit of bliss can’t resist an offering of opiates; a weak Fae must play any game of chance that it is invited to.

##### Rank 2 and 3

Rank 2 and 3 entities have moderate bans that curtail the creature’s activities in a more serious way than mere distraction. The murderous spirit of a car that has run down multiple people loses all Willpower if it doesn’t kill one person a month. A ghost must immediately dematerialize when it hears the sound of a cat.

##### Rank 4 and 5

Rank 4 and 5 entities have complicated bans that put an end to whatever the creature is trying to do — often in an explosive fashion. They have consequences in game traits or long-term actions, but esoteric requirements. The spirit of Mount Iliamna, a volcano in Alaska, must use its Numina to kill a victim named by anyone who makes it an offering of platinum that was mined from its foothills. The goetic concept of the Teenage Rebel from the Temenos can never submit to or obey any authority, order, or demand, and is driven to lash out against such.

They are not necessarily limited by specific actions, but esoteric requirements.

The goetic concept of the Teenage Rebel from the Temenos can never submit to or obey any authority, order, or demand, and is driven to lash out against such.

#### Banes

Invisible entities are not of the material world and react strangely to some elements of it. The interaction between their ephemeral forms and physical substance always contains a flaw — a bane — that damages the being’s Corpus through symbolic or mystical interference. The bane is a physical substance or energy that the entity can’t abide.
- Entities voluntarily attempting to come into contact with the bane must spend a Willpower point and succeed on a Resolve + Composure roll with a dice penalty equal to their Rank.
- Banes are solid to entities, even when they are in Twilight.
- Touching the bane causes 1 point of aggravated damage per turn if the entity is Materialized or in its home realm, and causes any relevant Condition to end unless the entity succeeds in a roll of Rank in dice. Repeat the roll every turn if contact holds.
- If the bane comes into contact with an item or person linked to a Fettered entity, the entity suffers 1 point of lethal damage per turn as long as contact holds. The entity must use the Unfetter Manifestation Effect to escape.
- Touching the bane while in Twilight causes 1 point of lethal damage per turn to non-Manifest entities.
- Touching the bane causes 1 point of lethal damage per turn to Supernal entities.
- If the bane is used as a weapon against the entity, the wounds suffered are aggravated for Manifest entities and those in their home realms, and lethal for entities still in Twilight or Supernal entities in the Fallen World.

Banes are increasingly esoteric and obscure for entities of increasing Rank.

##### Rank 1

Rank 1 entities have common substances and phenomena as banes. Ghosts burn at the touch of salt. The spirit of a forest is poisoned by the fumes of burning plastic.

##### Rank 2 and 3

Rank 2 and 3 spirits have difficult to obtain but still “natural” banes. A wild-wood spirit must be killed by a sharpened stake made of pine. A goetic entity of self-loathing is vulnerable to any mirror that it has seen its reflection in.

##### Rank 4 and 5

Rank 4 and 5 spirits have highly-specific banes that require great effort to acquire. The spirit of the US Treasury (the building) can be killed by a silver bullet made from a melted-down original dollar. A colossally powerful Beast of the Primal Wilds is vulnerable to the teeth and claws of a bear that killed a dozen or more humans.

The hierarchical nature of these beings also plays a part — Rank isn’t a social convention for them but a fundamental part of their natures. Entities of 2 Ranks or more higher than an opponent of the same type (a Rank 5 spirit attacking a Rank 3 spirit, for example) count as their opponent’s bane when using unarmed attacks, claws, or teeth.
