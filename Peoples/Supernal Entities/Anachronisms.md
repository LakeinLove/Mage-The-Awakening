_Manifest Fae of [[Arcadia]], the Anachronisms are beings of [[Time]] that can be called upon with a [[Summoning]]._

Anachronisms appear in a number of forms relating to the passage of time; they might appear to be young, old, or speeding through the life cycle over and over again. 

Some appear in forms related to timekeeping and chronology â€” clocks, calendars, and so forth. Mages call up Anachronisms for questions about the past, the future, and how to correct one and change the other.\
Anachronisms have knowledge and control of the timestream that no mage can hope to equal, but they are loathe to allow mages to affect the past (which has terrible consequences) or the future (which is in flux) too greatly.
