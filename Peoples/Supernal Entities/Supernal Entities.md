_Supernal Entities are beings that originate and live in the Supernal Realms. They answer questions or provide riddles, and are able to perform magic unfettered by the rules of the Fallen World_

---

The Supernal Realms and their relative Ruling [[Arcanum|Arcana]] describe the nature of the Supernal Beings that originate from them.

They are divided into #Recondite and #Manifest beings, depending on if their [[Arcanum|Arcana]] is #Subtle or #Gross.
