_Recondite Angels of [[Aether]], the Cherubim are beings of [[Prime]] that can be called upon with a [[Summoning]]._

---

These beings understand the raw power and potential of magic better than any other [[Supernal Entities]], and understand nuance better than their [[Seraphim]] cousins.\
They appear in a variety of forms, but they usually glow with [[Mana]] and often have multiple eyes. 

Some of them appear in animal forms like their Biblical namesakes.\
Mages summon Cherubim for advice on crafting Grimoires, Imbued Items, [[Verges and Demesnes|Demesnes]], and other magical workings, as well as how to counter or alter longstanding spells.
