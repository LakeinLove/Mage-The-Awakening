_Manifest Shades of [[Stygia]], the Apeirons are beings of [[Matter]] that can be called upon with a [[Summoning]]._

---

Drawing the name from the theoretical substance from which all matter is derived, these beings sometimes take human form; generally that of a craftsman, alchemist, or scientist. 

Just as often, they appear as something in between states of matter â€” ice melting to liquid, a luminous cloud of gas, or a humanoid figure made of quicksilver.\
Mages consult them about magical materials and how best to work them, the secrets of alchemy, and where to find lost [[Artifact|Artifacts]].
