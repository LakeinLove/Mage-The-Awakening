Nimbus: "Enlightening", things begin to glow, the air becomes charged with energy, the feel of heat and the smell of burning all accompany the casting of spells. With powerful magics, the world is imbued with a divine and preordained feeling, with words of worship often popping into the heads of onlookers.

Mages who awaken to the Path of the Mighty are connected to the Kingdom of Celestial Spheres, their divine purpose etched into their very beings the moment they awake.
The "Divine" blessed them in some way or another, be it gods or even a drive for self-improvement, they are almost always strongly motivated to safeguard their beliefs and serve as their staunch defenders.

There is no singular faith that unites mages of Aether, however they are by far the most united of the Awakened having a sense of kinship with their fellow Thaumaturges. They often do what is right and good, often utterly devoted to their own ideas of righteousness and going out of their way to correct things that have "gone astray".

Associated with the tarot card of "Strength", they have an unwavering purpose and confidence that both leads to astounding cases of victory and crippling displays of hubris. The Obrimos are raw powerhouses in magic, wielding the forces of reality itself and the ability to work with meta-magic to achieve true displays of power.

They are brave, noble, and convicted mages that will stand and fight for what they believe in until the last, but what that means can be up for debate. Better to fight long-term and win that way than necessarily make a suicidal stand, aye? This question often divides Obrimos fiercely.

Thaumaturges work miracles both potent and subtle, the breadth of their Arcana encompassing almost anything one could strive to achieve.

## Appearance
The Obrimos are the most respectful of their clothing, general opting for either tactically sound choices to allow freedom of movement and utility, or beautifully adorned ceremonial outfits of significant personal meaning. It would not be strange to see a Thaumaturge in shorts in the winter, their natural affinity with heat allowing them to wear clothes that best suit their activities, not limited by the weather.

## Common Backgrounds
The Obrimos are mages who have a personal relationship with conflict, be they iconoclasts fighting for what they believe is right, religious leaders fighting to spread the word of their gospel, soldiers fighting on the front lines of a war or even those suffering from chronic pain fighting their battles every day. Thaumaturges fight on every conceptual battlefield for their beliefs, and are stubborn to a fault. Debaters, tv personalities, celebrity activists, and survivors of great trauma are all types you find amongst a group of mages touched by the Path of the Mighty.
