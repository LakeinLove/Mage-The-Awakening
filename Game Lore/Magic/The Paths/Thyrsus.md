Bonded to the [[Watchtower of the Stone Book]] in the [[Primal Wild]]

Ruling Arcana: [[Life]] and [[Spirit]]
Inferior Arcanum: [[Mind]]
Favoured Resistance Attribute: [[Composure]]
Nimbus: "Vibrant", people feel 'alive' when around a casting Thyrsus, their hearts beating strong, their pulses rising, a thrill shooting down their spine. Onlookers see things moving behind stationary objects, patterns and abstract images painted on a blank canvas. With powerful magic, they can hear growls, whines, the buzzing of insects and the chirping of birds.

Mages who awaken to the Realm of the Primordial Wild tap directly into the primordial forces of vitality that drive creation. Their hearts beat with the pulse of the world, and they are moved by a passion and vigor that sets them apart from everyone else.

Thyrsus Shamans are hale and hearty, physically powerful and regularly in peak condition. Their connection to the Primal Wild is one that gives them an air of intensity, their insights and understandings of the world often strange and esoteric. They can be deeply passionate, truly investing wellsprings of passion into their every action and following through with all of their hearts. 

Those they love receive an incandescent passion and those they hate they despise with a terrifying intensity. Obsession runs through their lives, but so too does the freedom of the wild. They are able to let things go with a detachment that would make even the most dedicated [[Moros|Necromancer]] surprised, and their fierce commitment to ideals can rival and surpass that of a [[Obrimos|Thaumaturge]].

These primordial mages are powerful and cunning, their ability to commune with spirits allowing them to speak to concepts of fear, doubt, and even "that local burger joint that sells double cheeseburgers for $10 but they're a bargain 'cos they're huge".

## Appearance
They are generally extremely physically attractive, able to morph and change their own bodies, and can look like entirely different people throughout their lives, or even the next day if necessary. Their physical form normally holds some element of pride to them, and their focus on their tasks often results in them neglecting their clothing and etiquette. Naturally, they are as varied as anyone else, but their specific talent in communing with those non-corporeal does tend to leave their focus split between those who can perceive them and those who cannot.

## Common Backgrounds
There is often a stereotype among those of the Thyrsus that they are all extremely healthy individuals before Awakening, but that is as much a myth as it is truth. The Shamans that walk this path are those who are connected with life and the spiritual world, like doctors, midwives, farmers, botanists, eco-terrorists, veterinarians, and poets focused on the abstruse nature of what is real.
There is often a connection with those who have fought terminal diseases, crippling additions, and horrible chronic pain, and the Path of the Primal Wild; life is confronting for those people in ways most never endure.
