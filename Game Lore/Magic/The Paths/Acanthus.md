Inferior Arcanum: [[Forces]]
Favoured Resistance Attribute: [[Composure]]
Nimbus: "Fae", Things seem filled with possibility when they cast, and sometimes the air can take on a mystic hue, greens and blues swirling nigh-imperceptibly though the air. As they channel more energy strange and haunting singing can be heard, while time flows in an eerie, stilted manner. Time can feel like syrup and yet every moment seems crisp and clear.

This is the Path of the Thistle, the Kingdom of Enchantment, abode of the Fae, Enchanters or Witches epitomize the tarot trump card "The Fool", as they rely on luck and intuition to guide their way through life.

Manipulators of fate, mages who walk the Path of Thistle tend to be fickle and every changing, eager to try new things and always seem to excel at them.
Some call them the "Divine Fools" as they seem to stumble through life, never having need of money nor effort as everything just goes their way.

Naturally, these mages manipulate time and fate to ensure all goes their way, often not preparing for encounters and coming out on top instead. They are often called the wild cards of the Awakened world, and regardless of if they love them or hate them, no-one ever bets against them.

Their bond with Arcadia has them often portrayed as "free spirits" and "full of wonder", but also "immature" and "childish", many of these are never quite the truth.
As fickle as the Fae that live in Arcadia itself, they have such raw power over the outcomes of even the most dire of situations that it can often be hard for them to take anything too seriously.
They inspire hope and joy in others, as when they are around nothing ever feels impossible and their endless wonder at, and love of, the world can brighten even the darkest of rooms. Nimble minded and innovative, these Witches embody creativity and resourcefulness, able to create elaborate plans and ideas in seconds from the most scant of supplies.
They are knowledgeable and brilliant people who are rarely the center of a social group but their fresh perspective, quick thinking, and skills across a broad range of topics often has them as the one who brings all the new ideas and games to play; they've always got a new show to watch that they just *know* you're gonna love.

Just like their Fae cousins, an accusation that is often thrown around by mages in anger, Acanthus are also just as likely to avoid planning and strategy, simply wandering in to dangerous scenarios without a care in the world.

Despite their relatively carefree attitudes and positive outlooks, none are more frightening than an Acanthus when it counts.

## Appearance
Often, the Acanthus Witches are beautiful in Fae-like ways, attractive and soft features belying a cunning that often shines through their eyes in moments of tension. Their looks can go from an enchanting beauty to a fierce and terrifying vestige in a moment, as if their very sovereignty over Time and Fate manifests itself to distort their normally carefree expressions. The image of a snarling fox often comes to mind when a Acanthus is cornered.
Witches' appearances often change more than a normal awakened to reflect their individual personality, and in some conversations it can feel like they become a different person entirely when subjects change.

## Common Backgrounds
The Acanthus path is open to all those who are free of mind and thought, able to move with grace between ideas and concepts without friction. They are quick to learn, masters of many fields, and often have shed more than one version of themselves in the past.
They are lucky, tricky, and often get completely swept up in events throughout the world and concepts that tickle their fancy.
Students of complex and sprawling fields, brilliant gamblers who play the odds perfectly, actors who make audiences weep, and musicians who seem to know every instrument and song anyone could ever ask about.  They are also near prodigal tricksters, con artists, and scammers, as what better way to make money is there than to have every bank error work in your favour?
