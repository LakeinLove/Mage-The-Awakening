## Brief Description:
The Practice of Fraying is where the offensive magics truly begin. While some lesser hurts can be caused by magic before this point, Fraying is the least refined Practice almost wholly dedicated to the art of destruction. 
When used to directly inflict harm, Fraying spells always inflict bashing damage. (Indirect harm, however, can come in other forms; a mage using a Fraying effect to erode the welds holding part of a large jagged metal sculpture together, dropping it onto the head of an attacker, will likely cause lethal damage, instead.) 

Of course, Fraying magics need not directly hurt anyone or anything. They can also be used to damage less tangible things (such as by hindering a subject’s chances of success at an endeavor or dissolving knowledge).

## In Game:
Only rarely are Fraying spells covert in aspect, since they usually involve some rather spectacular effects. A few Fraying spells, however, may be cast with some degree of subtlety, and these spells are often prized by militant willworkers for both the spells’ lethality and their ability to be cast with reduced risk of a [[Paradox]]. 
For the most part, Fraying attacks that actually create some kind catalyst for the damage they inflict cost a point of [[Mana]], but this isn’t necessarily universal. Also, some Fraying spells can be scaled up, causing lethal damage with an appropriate [[Arcanum]] at four dots, and aggravated damage (which always costs [[Mana]]) at five dots.  
  
Although Fraying spells inflict only bashing damage when used to cause direct injury, they rank among the most useful of offensive magics. Certainly, an [[Practice of Unraveling|Unraveling]] effect will bring an enemy down faster, as will an [[Path of Unmaking|Unmaking]] spell, but such magics, used indiscriminately, can kill with alarming swiftness. 
In addition to the grievous harm this sort of thing can do to a mage’s [[Wisdom]], there are times when death isn’t the desired goal. If a malevolent spirit possesses a willworker’s friend, the mage probably isn’t willing to tear the victim’s body asunder to expel the entity.

## In Story:
As the proliferation of the [[Sleepers]], the eyes of the [[Fallen World]], increases, growing exponentially, most Fraying magics (which tend to be vulgar in their aspect) become less practical, save under the most dire or most extraordinary of circumstances. Also, since most mages, regardless of order (or lack thereof) recognize the validity of the [[Duel Arcane]] to one degree or another, Fraying magics are likely less popular now than they have been at any point in the past. Still, tradition, married to the good old-fashioned instinct to shoot the other guy before he shoots you, ensures that the Practice of Fraying will not stop being taught anytime soon. 
  
Discerning mages maintain uses for the Practice of Fraying throughout their lives. Such spells are subtler than most [[Practice of Unraveling|Unraveling]] or [[Path of Unmaking|Unmaking]] magics and, if used properly, don’t necessarily leave any obvious traces of injury. Some of the most successful and respected of [[Sentinels]] first attempt to fulfill their duties through the use of Fraying spells, before resorting to more destructive powers. A well-prepared mage with a solid command of Fraying magics is more than the equal of even the most skilled hand-to-hand [[Sleeper]] combatant.
