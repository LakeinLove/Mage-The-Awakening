Arcadia is the nascent plane of the [[Watchtower of Lunargent Thorn]] and mages of the path of [[Acanthus]].

It is a realm of enchantment, a glamour of intense beauty or horrific ugliness coats every entity in its supernal visage. There are extremes of every kind, but rarely any compromise, and absolutely no moderation.
It is a place that is ever-changing, shifting between things in a moment, with dances lasting for centuries and weeks of partying experienced in seconds. 
It is important to remember time has no true meaning in Arcadia, and thus a promise made there is eternal, until the keeper of your oath changes their mind or gets bored.

It is the challenge to stagnation, the search for betterment, and the quest for both novelty and experimentation.
