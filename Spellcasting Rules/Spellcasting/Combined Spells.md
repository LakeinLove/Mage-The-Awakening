_The Arcanum descriptions explain discrete spells and their effects. Sometimes, a mage wants more than one of these spell effects to take place in a single casting._

The result is called a combined spell. The main advantage of a combined spell is that it counts as a single spell toward the total spells a mage can have active, and all its effects activate simultaneously.

Mages can combine a number of spells determined by Gnosis (two at Gnosis 3, three at Gnosis 6, and four at Gnosis 9) together into a single casting.

Rotes cannot be combined, but Praxes can if the caster has all of the spells being combined as Praxes.

To cast a combined spell, the mage’s base dice pool is her Gnosis + lowest Arcanum of the spells cast; this pool suffers a –2 penalty for each additional spell over the first.\
For example, a mage with Gnosis 4 would cast a combined Mind 3, Forces 4 spell at Gnosis 4 + Mind 3 – 2. Spell modifications such as Yantras and spell factors affect the entire spellcasting pool and spell effects.\
Free Reach is determined as normal. Reach to alter spell factors applies to all spells, but additional Reach effects in a spell’s listing must be bought separately. Multiple spell effects must use the same scale unless the mage uses a Reach to separate the effects. Roll results are the same as single-cast spells.\
Spell Stacking still applies if the constituent spells affect the same thing.
