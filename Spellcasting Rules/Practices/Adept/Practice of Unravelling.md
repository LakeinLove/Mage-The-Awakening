_Unravelling spells can significantly impair or damage phenomena under the [[Arcanum]]’s purview, or directly inflict severe damage using the forces of an [[Arcanum]]. A raging storm might become a calm summer’s day ([[Forces]]), or solid iron reduced to dust ([[Matter]]); even spells can be torn asunder ([[Prime]]). Mages can hurl fire ([[Forces]]) at their enemies, or cause aneurysms and heart attacks with a glance ([[Mind]] or [[Life]])._

Damage inflicted by a direct Unravelling attack is lethal, but can be upgraded to aggravated by spending a point of Mana and one Reach.
